<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>These Lectures have been compiled as speedily as possible to meet the demand
for some quick but fairly comprehensive method whereby large bodies of men, divided
into small classes, might learn the elements of Navigation and thus assume, without
delay, their responsibilities as Junior Officers of the deck, Navigators and Assistant
Navigators in the United States Naval Auxiliary Reserve.</p>
<p>I realize that the haste with which the book has been written is apparent in
many places, and it is hoped that many evidences of this haste will disappear in
case further editions are printed. Besides acknowledging the help and information
which was secured from the list of navigational works, mentioned on another page,
I wish to mention particularly Prof. Charles Lane Poor&#39;s book, entitled &quot;Nautical
Science,&quot; from which was secured practically all of the information in the Lecture
on Planets and Stars (Tuesday - Week V); Commander W. C. P. Muir&#39;s book, &quot;Navigation
and Compass Deviations,&quot; and Lieutenant W. J. Henderson&#39;s book, &quot;Elements of Navigation,&quot;
the text of which was followed closely in discussing Variation and Deviation and
Traverse Sailing.</p>
<p>I desire to express my gratitude to Lieutenant Commander R. T. Merrill, 2nd,
U. S. N., for suggesting a detailed outline of the whole course; to Lieutenant Commander
B. O. Wills, U. S. N., for his valuable criticisms and almost daily help during
the preparation of these Lectures; to Lieutenant (j. g.) C. D. Draper, U. S. N.
R. F.; Lieutenant (j. g.) R. Brush, U. S. N. R. F., and Lieutenant (j. g.) P. C.
McPherson, U. S. N.&nbsp; R. F., for many criticisms and suggestions; and to Captain
Huntington, Seamen&#39;s Church Institute, for suggesting helpful diagrams, particularly
the one on page 44. This opportunity is also taken for thanking the many Instructors
in the School for their opinions on various questions that have come up in connection
with the course and for assistance in eliminating errors from the text.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">To those taking this course in Navigation:</span></p>
<p>These lectures have been written with the idea of explaining, in as simple language
as possible, the fundamental elements of Navigation as set forth in Bowditch&#39;s American
Practical Navigator. They will be given you during the time at the Training School
devoted to this subject. At present this time includes two morning periods of one
and a half hours each, separated by a recess of fifteen minutes. In general the
plan is to devote the first period to the lecture and the second period to practical
work.</p>
<p>Not many examples for practical work have been included in this book, but one
example, illustrating each new method, has been worked out. If you understand these
examples you should be able to understand others similar to them.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the course a portion of each second period will be devoted
to handling the sextant, work with charts, taking sights, etc. In short, every effort
will be made to duplicate, as nearly as possible, navigating conditions on board
a modern merchant ship.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Compass</span></h4>
<p>Everyone is supposed to know what a compass looks like. It is marked in two ways&#8212;the
old way and the new way. Put in your Note-Book this diagram:</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Compass" src="images/fig001.jpg" width="500" height="378" /> </p>
<p>The new way marked on the outside of the diagram, starts at North with 0°, increases
toward the right through East at 90°, South at 180°, West at 270° and back to North
again at 360° or 0°.</p>
<p>The old way, marked on the inside of the diagram, starts at North with 0°, goes
to the right to 90° at East and to the left to 90° at West. It also starts at South
with 0°, goes to the right to East at 90° and to the left to West at 90°.</p>
<p>A Compass Course can be named in degrees, according to either the new or old
way. For instance, the new way is just 45°. The old way for the same course is N
45° E. New way&nbsp;-&nbsp;100°. Old way for same course - S 80° E.</p>
<p>There is another way to name a compass course. It is by using the name of the
point toward which the ship is heading. On every ship the compass is placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg
8]</a></span> with the lubber line (a vertical black line on the compass bowl) vertical
and in the keel line of the ship. The lubber line, therefore, will always represent
the bow of the ship, and the point on the compass card nearest the lubber line will
be the point toward which the ship is heading.</p>
<p>The compass card of 360° is divided into 32 points. Each point, therefore, represents
11¼°. The four principal points are called <em>cardinal</em> points. They
are - North, East, South, West. Each cardinal point is 90° from the one
immediately adjacent to it. It is also 8 points from the one adjacent to it, as
90° is 8 points, i.e., 11¼° (one point) times 8. Midway between the cardinal
points are the inter-cardinal points. They are - N E, S E, S W, N W, and are 45°
or 4 points from the nearest cardinal point. Midway between each cardinal and
inter-cardinal point - at an angular distance of 22½° or 2 points, is a point
named by combining a cardinal point with an inter-cardinal point. For instance,
NNE, ENE, ESE, SSE, SSW, WSW, WNW, NNW. Midway between the last points named and
a cardinal or inter-cardinal point, at an angular distance of 11¼°, is a point
which bears the name of that cardinal or inter-cardinal point joined by the word
<em>by</em> to that of the cardinal point nearest to it. As, for instance,
N by E, E by N, E by S, S by E, S by W, W by S, W by N, N by W. Also NE x N, NE
x E, SE x E, SE x S, SW x S, SW x W, NW x W, NW x N. The angular distance between
each and every whole point is divided into 4 parts called half and quarter points
and each representing an angular measure of approximately 2° 49&#39;. In mentioning
fractional points, the U. S. Navy regulations are to name each point from North
and South toward East and West except that divisions adjacent to a cardinal or inter-cardinal
point are always referred to that point: For instance, N ½ E, N x E ½ E, NE ½ N,
NW ½ N, NW ¼ W, NW ¾ W, NW ¼ N.</p>
<p>Boxing the compass is naming each point and quarter-point in rotation, i.e.,
starting at North and going around to the right back to North again. Every man should
be able to identify and name any point or quarter-point on the compass card.</p>
<p>In changing a point course into a degree course, for either new or old compass,
a guide is herewith furnished you. This should be pasted into the front of your
Bowditch Epitome. It shows, from left to right, the name of the point course, its
angular measure in the new compass and its angular measure in the old compass. It
also shows at the bottom, the angular measure of each division of one point. In
understanding this guide, remember that each course is expressed in degrees or degrees
and minutes.</p>
<p>Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>In Navigation, each degree is written thus °. Each fraction of a degree is expressed
in minutes and written thus &#39;. There are 60&#39; in each degree. Each fraction of a
minute is expressed in seconds and is written &quot;. There are 60&quot; in each minute. Four
degrees, ten minutes and thirty seconds would be written thus: 4° 10&#39; 30&quot;.</p>
<p>Although this guide just given you is given as an aid to quickly transfer a point
course into a new or old compass course - or vice versa - you should learn to do this
yourself, after awhile, without the guide.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg

<p>I will show you just how each one of these courses is secured from the guide
just given you.</p>
<p>Note to Instructor: After explaining these courses in detail, assign for
reading <em>in the class room</em> the following articles in Bowditch: Arts. 25-26-27-28-29-30-31-32,
74-75-76-77-78-79-80-81-82.</p>
<p>Every compass, if correct, would have its needle point directly to the real
or <em>true</em> North. But practically no compass with which you will become familiar will
be correct. It will have an error in it due to the magnetism of the earth. This
is called Variation. It will also have an error in it due to the magnetism of the
iron in the ship. This is called Deviation. You are undoubtedly familiar with the
fact that the earth is a huge magnet and that the magnets in a compass are affected
thereby. In other words, the North and South magnetic poles, running through the center of the earth, do not point true North and South. They point at an angle either
East or West of the North and South. The amount of this angle in any one spot on
the earth is the amount of Variation at that spot. In navigating a ship you must
take into account the amount of this Variation. The amount of allowance to be made
and the direction (i.e. either East or West) in which it is to be applied are usually
indicated on the chart. On large charts, such as those of the North Atlantic, will
be found irregular lines running over the chart, and having beside them such notations
as 10° W, 15° W, etc. Some lines are marked &quot;No Variation.&quot; In such cases no allowance
need be made. On harbor charts or other small charts, the Variation is shown by
the compass-card printed on the chart. The North point of this card will be found
slewed around from the point marking True North and in the compass card will be
some such inscription as this: &quot;Variation 9° West in 1914. Increasing 6&#39; per year.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg
10]</a></span></p>
<p>Now let us see how we apply this Variation so that although our compass needle
does not point to true North, we can make a correction which will give us our true
course in spite of the compass reading. Note these diagrams:</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Compass Variation" src="images/fig002.jpg" width="600" height="323" />
</p>
<p>The outer circle represents the sea horizon with the long arrow pointing to true
North. The inner circle represents the compass card. In the diagram to the left,
the compass needle is pointing three whole points to the left or West of True North.
In other words, if your compass said you were heading NE x N, you would not actually
be heading NE x N. You would be heading true North.</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Compass Course" src="images/fig003.jpg" width="600" height="286" />
</p>
<p>In other words, standing in the center of the compass and looking toward the
circumference, you would find that every true course you sailed would be three
points to the <em>left</em> of the compass course. That is called Westerly Variation.</p>
<p>Now look at the diagram to the right. The compass needle is pointing three whole
points to the right or East of True North. In other words, standing in the center
of the compass and looking toward the circumference, you would find that every
true course you sailed would be three points to the <em>right</em> of the compass course. That
is called Easterly Variation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg
11]</a></span></p>
<p>Hence we have these rules, which put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p class="center"><em>To convert a compass course into a true course</em></p>
<p>When the Variation is westerly, the true course will be as many points to the
left of the compass course as there are points or degrees of Variation. When the
Variation is easterly, the true course will be as many points or degrees to the
right of the compass course.</p>
<p class="center"><em>To convert a true course into a compass course</em></p>
<p>The converse of the above rule is true. In other words, Variation westerly, compass
to the right of true course; variation easterly, compass course to the left.</p>
<p class="center">DEVIATION</p>
<p>As stated before, Deviation causes an error in the Compass due to the magnetism
of the iron in the ship. When a ship turns, the compass card does not turn, but
the relation of the iron&#39;s magnetism to the magnets in the compass is altered. Hence,
every change in course causes a new amount of Deviation which must be allowed for
in correcting the compass reading. It is customary in merchant vessels to have the
compasses adjusted while the ship is in port. The adjuster tries to counteract the
Deviation all he can by magnets, and then gives the master of the ship a table of
the Deviation errors remaining. These tables are not to be depended upon, as they
are only accurate for a short time. Ways will be taught you to find the Deviation
yourself, and those ways are the only ones you can depend upon.</p>
<p>Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>Westerly Deviation is applied exactly as westerly Variation. Easterly Deviation
is applied exactly as easterly Variation.</p>
<p>The amount of Variation plus the amount of Deviation is called the Compass Error.
For instance, a Variation of 10° W plus a Deviation of 5° W equals a compass error
of 15° W, or a Variation of 10° W plus a Deviation of 5° E leaves a net compass
error of 5° W.</p>
<p class="center">LEEWAY</p>
<p>Leeway is not an error of the compass, but it has to be compensated for in steaming
any distance. Hence it is mentioned here. A ship steaming with a strong wind or
current abeam, will slide off to the leeward more or less. Hence, her course will
have to be corrected for Leeway as well as for Variation and Deviation.</p>
<p>Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>Leeway on the starboard tack is the same as westerly Variation. Leeway on the
port tack is the same as easterly Variation. This is apparent from the following
diagram:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Effect of the wind on a ship" src="images/fig004.jpg" width="500" height="240" /></p>
<p>As the wind, blowing from the North, hits the left hand ship, for instance, on
her starboard side, it shoves the ship to the left of her true course by the number
of points or degrees of leeway.</p>
<p>Leave a space and put the following heading in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>I. Complete rule for converting a compass course into a true course:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">1. Change the compass course into a new compass
reading.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">4. Apply port tack Leeway +.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">5. Apply starboard tack Leeway -.</span><br />
II. Complete rule for converting a true course into a compass course:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">1. Reverse the above signs in applying each correction.</span><br />

<h3><a name="WEDNESDAY_LECTURE_I" id="WEDNESDAY_LECTURE_I"></a>WEDNESDAY LECTURE</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Pelorus, Parallel Rulers, The Lead, Sounding Machine, Dividers
And Log</span></h4>
<p class="center"><em>I.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pelorus</em></p>
<p>This is an instrument for taking bearings of distant objects, and for taking
bearings of celestial bodies such as the sun, stars, etc. It consists of a circular,
flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> metallic
ring, mounted on gimbals, upon a vertical standard. The best point to mount it is
in the bow or on the bridge of the ship, where a clear view for taking bearings
can be had. The center line of the pelorus should also be directly over the keel
line of the ship. The inner edge of the metallic ring is engraved in degrees - the
0° or 360° and the 180° marks indicating a fore-and-aft line parallel to the keel
of the ship. Within this ring a ground glass dial is pivoted. This ground glass
dial has painted upon it a compass card divided into points and sub-divisions and
into 360°. This dial is capable of being moved around, but can also be clamped to
the outside ring. Pivoted with the glass dial and flat ring is a horizontal bar
carrying at both of its extremes a sight vane. This sight vane can be clamped in
any position independently of the ground glass dial, which can be moved freely beneath
it. An indicator showing the direction the sight vane points can be read upon the
compass card on the glass dial. If the glass dial be revolved until the degree of
demarcation, which is coincident with the right ahead marking on the flat ring,
is the same as that which points to the lubber&#39;s line of the ship&#39;s compass, then
all directions indicated by the glass dial will be parallel to the corresponding
directions of the ship&#39;s compass, and all bearings taken will be compass bearings,
i.e., as though taken from the compass itself. In other words, it is just as though
you took the compass out of its place in the pilot house, or wherever it is regularly
situated, put it down where the pelorus is, and took a bearing from it of any object
desired.</p>
<p>In taking a bearing by pelorus, two facts must be kept in mind. First, that when
the bearing is taken, the exact heading, as shown by the ship&#39;s compass, is the
heading shown by the pelorus. In other words, if the ship is heading NW, the pelorus
must be set with the NW point on the lubber line when the bearing is taken of any
object. Second, it must be remembered that the bearing of any object obtained from
the pelorus is the bearing <em>by compass</em>. To get the true bearing of the same object
you must make the proper corrections for Variation and Deviation. This can be compensated
for by setting the glass dial at a point to the right or left of the compass heading
to correspond with the compass error; then the bearing of any object will be the
true bearing. But naturally, you will not be able to make compensation for these
errors unless you have immediately before found the correct amount of the compass
error.</p>
<p class="center"><em>Parallel Rulers</em></p>
<p>The parallel rulers need no explanation except for the way in which they are
used on a chart. Supposing, for instance, you wish to steam from Pelham Bay to the
red buoy off the westerly end of Great Captain&#39;s Island. Take your chart, mark by
a pencil point the place left and the place to go to and draw a straight line intersecting
these two points. Now place the parallel rulers along that line and slide them over
until the nearest edge intersects the center of the compass rose at the bottom or
side of the chart. Look along the ruler&#39;s edge to find where it cuts the circumference
of the compass rose. That point on the compass rose will be the <em>true</em> compass
course, and can be expressed in either the new or old compass, as, for instance,
60° or N 60° E. Remember, however, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg
14]</a></span> this is the <em>true</em> course. In order to change it into the
compass course of your ship, you must make the proper corrections for the compass
error, i.e., Variation and Deviation and for Leeway, if any.</p>
<p class="center"><em>The Lead and Sounding Machine</em></p>
<p>The lead, as you know, is used to ascertain the depth of the water and, when
necessary, the character of the bottom. There are two kinds of leads: the hand lead
and deep-sea lead. The first weighs from 7 to 14 pounds and has markings to 25 fathoms.
The second weighs from 30 to 100 pounds and is used in depths up to and over 100
fathoms. Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>Fathoms which correspond with the depths marked are called <em>marks</em>. All
other depths are called <em>deeps</em>. The hand lead is marked as follows:</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">2 fathoms - 2 strips of leather.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">3 fathoms - 3 strips of leather or blue rag.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">5 fathoms - A white rag.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">7 fathoms - A red rag.</span><br />
10 fathoms - A piece of leather with one hole in it.<br />
13 fathoms - Same as at 3.<br />
15 fathoms - Same as at 5.<br />
17 fathoms - Same as at 7.<br />
20 fathoms - 2 knots or piece of leather with 2 holes.<br />
25 fathoms - 1 knot.<br />
30 fathoms - 3 knots.<br />
35 fathoms - 1 knot.<br />
40 fathoms - 4 knots.<br />
And so on up to 100 fathoms.<br />
</p>
<p>The large hand leads are hollowed out on the lower end so that an &quot;arming&quot; of
tallow can be put in. This will bring up a specimen of the bottom, which should
be compared with the description found on the chart.</p>
<p>All up-to-date sea-going ships should be fitted with Sir William Thompson&#39;s Sounding
Machine (see picture in B. J. Manual). This machine consists of a cylinder around
which are wound about 300 fathoms of piano wire. To the end of this is attached
a heavy lead. An index on the side of the instrument records the number of fathoms
of wire paid out. Above the lead is a copper cylindrical case in which is placed
a glass tube open only at the bottom and chemically colored inside. The pressure
of the sea forces water up into this tube, as it goes down, a distance proportionate
to the depth, and the color is removed. When hoisted, the tube is laid upon a prepared
scale, and the height to which the water has been forced inside shows the depth
in fathoms on the scale.</p>
<p class="center">DIVIDERS</p>
<p>The dividers are nothing but an instrument for measuring distances, etc., on
the chart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">THE LOG</p>
<p>There are two kinds of logs - the chip log, used for measuring the speed of the
ship, and the patent log, used for measuring distance run.</p>
<p>The chip log consists of a reel, line, toggle and chip. Usually a second glass
is used for measuring time. The chip is the triangular piece of wood ballasted with
lead to ride point up. The toggle is a little wooden case into which a peg, joining
the ends of the two lower lines of the bridle, is set in such a way that a jerk
on the line will free it, causing the log to lie flat so that it can be hauled in.
The first 10 or 15 fathoms of line from the log-chip are called &quot;stray line,&quot; and
the end of this is distinguished by a mark of red bunting. Its purpose is to let
the chip get clear of the vessel&#39;s wake. The marks on the line (called knots) are
pieces of fish line running through the strands of the reel line to the number of
two, three, four, etc. A piece of white bunting marks every two-tenths of a knot.
This is because the run of the ship is recorded in knots and tenths. The knots of
fish line are 47 feet 4 inches from each other.</p>
<p>The log glass measures 28 seconds in time. For high rates of speed, a 14 second
glass is used. Then the number of knots shown by the log line must be doubled. The
principle of the chip log is that each division of the log line bears the same ratio
to a nautical mile that the log glass does to the hour. In other words, if 10 knots
or divisions of the log line run out while the 28 second glass empties itself, the
ship&#39;s speed is 10 knots per hour. If ten knots or divisions run out while the 14
second glass empties itself, the ship&#39;s speed is 20 knots per hour.</p>
<p>The patent or towing log consists of a dial, line and rotator. The large circle
of the dial records the knots and the small circle tenths of knots. When changing
course, read the log and enter it in the log book. When changing course again, read
the log again. The difference between the two readings will be the distance run.</p>
<p>Both logs are liable to error. A following sea makes them under-rate, a head
sea over-rate. With both logs you must allow for currents. If a current is against
you - and you know its rate - you must deduct its rate from that recorded in the log
and vice versa. The reason for this is that your log measures your speed through
the water. What you must find is your actual distance made good over the earth&#39;s
surface.</p>
<p>Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>Between Sandy Hook and Fort Hamilton, bound due North, speed by chip-log was
10 knots, tidal current setting North 2 knots per hour; what did the ship make per
hour? Answer: 12 knots.</p>
<p>At sea in North Sea ship heading S x W, patent log bet. 8 A.M. and 12 M. registered
32 miles, current running N x E 2 knots per hour; what was the actual distance made
good? Answer: 24 miles.</p>
<p>Directions for allowing for a current setting diagonally across a ship&#39;s course
will be given in the proper place.</p>

<h3><a name="THURSDAY_LECTURE_I" id="THURSDAY_LECTURE_I"></a>THURSDAY LECTURE</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Chart</span></h4>
<p class="center"><em>Aids to Navigation</em></p>
<p>A chart is a map of an ocean, bay, sound or other navigable water. It shows the
character of the coast, heights of mountains, depths at low water, direction and
velocity of tidal currents, location, character, height and radius of visibility
of all beacon lights, location of rocks, shoals, buoys, and nature of the bottom
wherever soundings can be obtained.</p>
<p>The top of the chart is North unless otherwise noted. When in doubt as to where
North is, consult the compass card printed somewhere on the chart. On sea charts,
such as those of the North Atlantic, only the true compass is printed, with the
amount and direction of Variation indicated by lines on the chart.</p>
<p>Parallels of latitude are shown by straight lines running parallel to each other
across the chart. The degrees and minutes of these parallels are given on the perpendicular
border of the chart. Meridians of longitude are shown by straight lines running
up and down, perpendicular to the parallels of latitude, and the degrees and minutes
of these meridians are given on the horizontal border of the chart.</p>
<p>Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>A minute of latitude is always a mile, because parallels of latitude are equidistant
at all places. A minute of longitude is a mile only on the equator, for the meridians
are coming closer to each other as they converge toward either pole. They come together
at the North and South poles, and here there is no longitude.</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>I can explain this very easily by reference to the following illustration:</p>
<p class="center">
<img src="images/fig005.jpg" width="501" height="242" alt="Comparison of latitude and longitude" />
</p>
<p>As every parallel of latitude is a circle of 360° the distance from A to B will
be the same number of degrees, minutes and seconds whether measured upon parallel
AA&#39; or EE&#39;, but it will not be the same number of miles as the meridians of longi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg
17]</a></span>tude are gradually converging toward the poles. On the other hand,
the distances from A to C, C to D, D to E, etc., must be the same because the lines
AA&#39;, CC&#39;, DD&#39;, EE&#39; are all parallel. That is why the distance is always measured
on the latitude scale (i.e. on the vertical border of the chart), and a minute of
latitude is always a mile on the chart, no matter in what locality your ship happens
to be.</p>
<p>You should be able to understand any kind of information given you on a chart.
For instance, what are the various kinds of buoys and how are they marked?</p>
<p>Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. In coming from seaward, red buoys mark the starboard side of the channel,
and black buoys the port side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Dangers and obstructions which may be passed on either hand are marked by
buoys with red and black horizontal stripes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3. Buoys indicating the fairway are marked with black and white vertical stripes

<p>&nbsp;4. Sunken wrecks are marked by red and black striped buoys described in No. 2.
In foreign countries green buoys are frequently used to mark sunken wrecks.</p>

points, the color and number indicating on which side they shall be passed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;9. Soundings in plain white are in fathoms; those on shaded parts are in feet.
On large ocean charts fathom curves, showing the range of soundings of 10, 20, 30,
40, etc., fathoms are shown.</p>

<p>12. Rocks just under water are shown by a cross surrounded by a dotted circle;
rocks above water, by a dotted circle with dots inside it.</p>
<p>Practically all charts you will use will be called Mercator charts. Just how
they are constructed is a difficult mathematical affair but, roughly, the idea of
their construction is based upon the earth being a cylinder, instead of a sphere.
Hence, the meridians of longitude, instead of converging at the poles, are parallel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg
18]</a></span> lines. This compels the parallels of latitude to be adjusted correspondingly.
Although such a chart in any one locality is out of proportion compared with some
distant part of the earth&#39;s surface, it is nevertheless in proportion for the distance
you can travel in a day or possibly a week - and that is all you desire. The Hydrographic
Office publishes blank Mercator charts for all latitudes in which they can be used
for plotting your position. It makes no difference what longitude you are in for,
on a Mercator chart, meridians of longitude are all marked parallel. It makes a
great difference, however, what latitude you are in, as in each a mile is of different
length on the chart. Hence, it will be impossible for you to correctly plot your
course and distance sailed unless you have a chart which shows on it the degrees
of latitude in which you are. For instance, if your Mercator chart shows parallels
of latitude from 30° to 40° that chart must be used when you are in one of those
latitudes. When you move into 41° or 29°, you must be sure to change your plotting
chart accordingly. In very high latitudes and near the North pole, the Mercator
chart is worthless. How can you steer for the North pole when the meridians of your
chart never come together at any pole? For the same reason, bearings of distant
objects may be slightly off when laid down on this chart in a straight line. On
the whole, however, the Mercator chart answers the mariner&#39;s needs so far as all
practical purposes are concerned.</p>
<p>The instruments used in consulting a chart, i.e., parallel rulers, dividers,
etc. have already been described. The only way to lay down a course and read it
is by practice.</p>
<p>The one important thing to remember in laying down a course, is that what you
lay down is a true course. To steam this course yourself, you must make the proper
correction for your compass error.</p>

<p>If any time in class room is left, spend it in laying down courses on the chart
and reading them; also in answering such questions as these:</p>
<p>1. I desire to sail a true course of NE. My compass error is 2 points Westerly
Variation and 1 point Easterly Deviation. What compass course shall I sail?</p>
<p>2. I desire to sail a true course of SW x W. My Variation is 11° W, Deviation
2 pts. W and Leeway 1 pt. starboard. What compass course shall I sail?</p>
<p>3. I desire to sail a true course of 235°. My compass error is 4 pts. E Variation,
27° W Deviation, Leeway 1 pt. port. What compass course shall I sail?</p>
<p>4. I desire to sail a true course of S 65° W. My compass error is 10° E Variation,

<h3><a name="FRIDAY_LECTURE_I" id="FRIDAY_LECTURE_I"></a>FRIDAY LECTURE</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Protractor And Sextant</span></h4>
<p>The protractor is an instrument used to shape long courses. There are many kinds.
The simplest and the one most in use is merely a piece of transparent celluloid
with a compass card printed on it and a string attached to the center of the
compass card. To find your course by protractor, put the protractor down on the
chart so that the North and South line on the compass card of the protractor
will be immediately over a meridian of longitude on the chart, or be exactly
parallel to one, and will intersect the point from which you intend to depart.
Then stretch your string along the course you desire to steam. Where this string
cuts the compass card, will be the direction of your course. Remember, however,
that this will be the <em>true</em> course
to sail. In order to convert this true course into your compass course, allow for
Variation and Deviation according to the rules already given you.</p>
<p>In case you know the exact amount of Variation and Deviation at the time you
lay down the course - and your course is not far - you can get your compass course in
one operation by setting the North point of your protractor as far East or West
of the meridian as the amount of your compass error is. By then proceeding as before,
the course indicated on the compass card will be the compass course to sail. This
method should not be used where your course in one direction is long or where your
course is short but in two or more directions. The reason for this is that in both
cases, either your Variation or Deviation may change and throw you off.</p>
<p>Practically all navigation in strange waters in sight of land and in all waters
out of sight of land depends upon the determination of angles. The angle at which
a lighthouse is seen from your ship will give you much information that may be absolutely
necessary for your safety. The angular altitude of the sun, star or planet does
the same. The very heart of Navigation is based upon dealing with angles of all
kinds. The instrument, therefore, that measures these angles is the most important
of any used in Navigation and you must become thoroughly familiar with it. It is
the sextant or some member of the sextant family - such as the quadrant, octant, etc.
The sextant is the one most in use and so will be described first.</p>
<p>Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>The sextant has the following parts: (Instructor points to each.)</p>
<table style="width: 100%" id="table77">
	<tr>
		<td>1. Mirror</td>
		<td>6. Handle</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2. Telescope</td>
		<td>7. Sliding Limb</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3. Horizon Glass</td>
		<td>8. Reading Glass</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4. Shade Glasses</td>
		<td>9. Tangent Screw</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>5. Back Shade Glasses</td>
		<td>10. Arc</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>In getting angles of land-marks or buoys, the sextant is held by the handle No.
6 in a horizontal position. The vernier arrow in the sliding limb is set on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg
20]</a></span> zero. Now, suppose you wish to get the angular distance between two
lighthouses as seen from the bridge of your ship. (Draw diagram.)</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Taking sights on two lighthouses" src="images/fig006.jpg" width="500" height="401" />
</p>
<p>Look at one lighthouse through the line of sight and true horizon part of the
horizon glass. Now, move the sliding limb along the arc gradually until you see
the other lighthouse in the reflected horizon of the horizon glass. When one lighthouse
in the true horizon is directly on top of the other lighthouse in the reflected
horizon, clamp the sliding limb. If any additional adjustment must be made, make
it with the tangent screw No. 9.</p>
<p>Now look through the reading glass No. 8. You should see that the arc is divided
into degrees and sixths of degrees in the following manner:</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Close-up of sextant vernier scale" src="images/fig007.jpg" width="500" height="152" />
</p>
<p>Now, as every degree is divided into sixty minutes, one-sixth of a degree is
10 minutes. In other words, each of the divisions of a degree on this arc represents
10 minutes.</p>
<p>Now on the vernier in the sliding limb, directly under the arc, is the same kind
of a division. But these divisions on the vernier represent minutes and sixths of
a minute, or 10 seconds.</p>
<p>To read the angle, the zero point on the vernier is used as a starting point.
If it exactly coincides with one of the lines on the scale of the arc, that line
gives the measurement of the angle. In the following illustration the angle is 10½
degrees or 10° 30&#39;:</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Close-up of sextant vernier scale" src="images/fig008.jpg" width="500" height="163" /><br />
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p>If however, you find the zero on the vernier has passed a line of the arc, your
angle is more than 10° 30&#39; as in this:</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Close-up of sextant vernier scale" src="images/fig009.jpg" width="500" height="188" /><br />
</p>
<p>You must then look along the vernier to the left until you find the point where
the lines do coincide. Then add the number of minutes and sixths of a minute shown
on the vernier between zero and the point where the lines coincide to the number
of degrees and minutes shown on the arc at the line which the vernier zero has passed,
and the sum will be the angle measured by the instrument.</p>
<p>Now in measuring the altitude of the sun or other celestial body, exactly the
same process is gone through except that the sextant is held vertically instead
of horizontally. You look through the telescope toward that part of the sea directly
beneath the celestial body to be observed. You then move the sliding limb until
the image of the celestial body appears in the horizon glass, and is made to &quot;kiss&quot;
the horizon, i.e., its lowest point just touching the horizon. The sliding limb
is then screwed down and the angle read. More about this will be mentioned when
we come to Celestial Navigation.</p>
<p>Every sextant is liable to be in error. To detect this error there are four adjustments
to be made. These adjustments do not need to be learned by heart, but I will mention
them:</p>
<p>1. The mirror must be perpendicular to the plane of the arc. To prove whether
it is or not, set the vernier on about 60°, and look slantingly through the mirror.
If the true and reflected images of the arc coincide, no adjustment is necessary.
If not, the glass must be straightened by turning the screws at the back.</p>
<p>2. The horizon glass must be perpendicular to the plane of the arc. Set the vernier
on zero and look slantingly through the horizon glass. If the true and reflected
horizons show one unbroken line, no adjustment is necessary. If not, turn the screw
at the back until they do.</p>
<p>3. Horizon glass and mirror must be parallel. Set the vernier on zero. Hold the
instrument vertically and look through the line of sight and horizon glass. If the
true and reflected horizons coincide, no adjustment is necessary. If they do not,
adjust the horizon glass.</p>
<p>4. The line of sight (telescope) must be parallel to the plane of the arc. This
adjustment is verified by observing two stars in a certain way and then performing
other operations that are described in Bowditch, Art. 247.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg
22]</a></span></p>
<p>Do not try to adjust your sextant yourself. Have it adjusted by an expert on
shore. Then, if there is any error, allow for it. An error after adjustment is called
the Index Error.</p>
<p>Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>How to find and apply the IE (Index Error):</p>
<p>Set the sliding limb at zero on the arc, hold the instrument perpendicularly
and look at the horizon. Move the sliding limb forward or backward slowly until
the true horizon and reflected horizon form one unbroken line. Clamp the limb and
read the angle. This is the IE. If the vernier zero is to the left of the zero on
the arc, the IE is minus and it is to be subtracted from any angle you read, to
get the correct angle. If the vernier zero is to the right of the zero on the arc,
the IE is plus and is to be added to any angle you read to get the correct angle.
Index error is expressed thus: IE + 2&#39; 30&quot; or IE - 2&#39; 30&quot;.</p>
<p>Quadrants, octants and quintants work on exactly the same principles as the sextant,
except that the divisions on the arc and the vernier differ in number from the sixth
divisions on the arc and vernier of the sextant.</p>
<p>If any time is left, spend it in marking courses with the protractor and handling
the sextant.</p>

<h3><a name="SATURDAY_LECTURE_I" id="SATURDAY_LECTURE_I"></a>SATURDAY LECTURE</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Fixes, Angles By Bearings And Sextant</span></h4>
<p>There are five good ways of fixing your position (obtaining a &quot;fix,&quot; as it is
called) providing you are within sight of landmarks which you can identify or in
comparatively shoal water.</p>
<p>Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>1. Cross bearings of two known objects.</p>
<p>2. Bearing and distance of a known object, the height of which is known.</p>
<p>3. Two bearings of a known object separated by an interval of time, with a run
during that interval.</p>
<p>4. Sextant angles between three known objects.</p>
<p>5. Using the compass, log and lead in a fog or in unfamiliar waters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">1. Cross bearings of two known objects.</p>
<p>Select two objects marked on the chart, so far apart that each will bear about
45° off your bow but in opposite directions. These bearings will be secured in the
best way by the use of your pelorus. Correct each bearing for Variation and Deviation
so that it will be a true bearing. Then with the parallel rulers carry the bearing
of one object from the chart compass card until you can intersect the object itself
and draw a line through it. Do exactly the same with the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg
23]</a></span> object. Where the two lines intersect, will be the position of the
ship at the time the bearings were taken.</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Position of ship from bearings" src="images/fig010.jpg" width="400" height="269" />
</p>
<p>Now supposing you wish to find the latitude and longitude of that position of
the ship. For the latitude, measure the distance of the place from the nearest parallel
with the dividers. Take the dividers to the latitude scale at the side of the chart
and put one point of them on the same parallel. Where the other point touches on
the latitude scale, will be the latitude desired. For the longitude, do exactly
the same thing, but use a meridian of longitude instead of a parallel of latitude
and read from the longitude scale at the top or bottom of the chart instead of from
the side.</p>
<p class="center">2. Bearing and distance of a known object, the height of which is known.</p>
<p>Take a bearing of, say, a lighthouse the height of which is known. The height
of all lighthouses on the Atlantic Coast can be found in a book published by the
U.S. Dept. of Commerce. Correct the bearing, as mentioned in case No. 1. Now read
the angle of the height of that light by using your sextant. Do this by putting
the vernier 0 on the arc 0, sliding the limb slowly forward until the top of the
lighthouse in the reflected horizon just touches the bottom of the lighthouse in
the true horizon. With this angle and the known height of the light, enter Table
33 in Bowditch. At the left of the Table will be found the distance off in knots.
This method can be used with any fairly perpendicular object, the height of which
is known and which is not more than 5 knots away, as Table 33 is not made out for
greater distances.</p>
<p class="center">3. Two bearings of the same object, separated by an interval of time and<img alt="Distance run by a ship" src="images/fig011.jpg" width="213" height="300" style="float: right" class="style6" />
with a run during that interval.</p>
<p>Take a compass bearing of some prominent object when it is either 2, 3 or 4 points
off the bow. Take another bearing of the same object when it is either 4, 6 or 8
points off the bow. The distance run by the ship between the two bearings will be
her distance from the observed object at the second bearing. &quot;The distance run is
the distance off.&quot;<br />
<br />
A diagram will show clearly just why this is so:</p>
<p>The ship at A finds the light bearing NNW 2 points off her bow. At B, when
the light bears NW and 4 points off, the log registers the distance from A to B
9 miles. 9 miles, then, will be the distance from the light itself when the ship
is at B. The mathematical reason for this is that the distance run is one side of
an isosceles triangle. Such triangles have their two sides of equal length. For
that reason, the distance run is the distance off. Now the same fact holds true
in running from B, which is 4 points off the bow, to C, which is 8 points off the
bow, or directly abeam. The log shows the distance run between B and C is 6.3 miles.
Hence, the ship is 6.3 miles from the light when directly abeam of it. This last
4 and 8 point bearing is what is known as the &quot;bow and beam&quot; bearing, and is the
standard method used in coastwise navigation. Any one of these methods is of great
value in fixing your position with relation to the land, when you are about to go
to sea.</p>
<p class="center">4. Sextant angles between three known objects.</p>
<p>This method is the most accurate of all. Because of its precision it is the one
used by the Government in placing buoys, etc. Take three known objects such as A,
B and C which are from 30° to 60° from each other.</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Sextant angles between three known objects" src="images/fig012.jpg" width="400" height="300" />
</p>
<p>With a sextant, read the angle from A to B and from B to C. Place a piece of
transparent paper over the compass card and draw three lines from the center of
the compass card to the circumference in such a way that the angles secured by the
sextant will be formed by the three lines drawn. Now take this paper with the angles
on it and fit it on the chart so that the three objects of which angles were taken
will be intersected by the three lines on the paper. Where the point S is (in my
diagram) will be the point of the ship&#39;s position at the time of sight. To secure
greater accuracy the two angles should be taken at the same time by two observers.</p>
<p class="center">5. Using a compass, log and lead when you are in a fog or unfamiliar waters.</p>
<p>Supposing that you are near land and want to fix your position but have no landmarks
which you can recognize. Here is a method to help you out:</p>
<p>Take a piece of tracing paper and rule a vertical line on it. This will represent
a meridian of longitude. Take casts of the lead at regular intervals, noting the
time at which each is taken, and the distance logged between each two. The compass
corrected for Variation and Deviation will show your course. Rule a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg
25]</a></span> line on the tracing paper in the direction of your course, using
the vertical line as a N and S meridian. Measure off on the course line by the scale
of miles in your chart, the distance run between casts and opposite each one note
the time, depth ascertained and, if possible, nature of the bottom. Now lay this
paper down on the chart which can be seen under it, in about the position you believe
yourself in when you made the first cast. If your chain of soundings agrees with
those on the chart, you are all right. If not, move the paper about, keeping the
vertical line due N and S, till you find the place on the chart that does agree
with you. That is your line of position. You will never find in that locality any
other place where the chain of soundings are the same on the same course you are
steaming. This is the only method by soundings that you can use in thick weather
and it is an invaluable one.</p>
<p>Put in your Note-Book this diagram:</p>
<p>
<img alt="Soundings at different times" src="images/fig013.jpg" width="400" height="392" /><br />
</p>
<p>Assign for Night Work, Review for Weekly Examination to be held on Monday.</p>
<p>Add an explanation of the Deviation Card in Bowditch, page 41.</p>
<p>Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>Entering New York Harbor, ship heading W ¾ N, Variation 9° W. Observed by pelorus
the following objects:</p>
<p>Buoy No. 1&nbsp; -&nbsp; ENE ¼ E<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4&nbsp; -&nbsp; NW ¼ N</span><br />
</p>
<p>Required true bearings of objects observed.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>From Deviation Card in Bowditch, p. 41, Deviation on W ¾ N course is 5° E. Hence,
Compass Error is 5° E (Dev.) + 9° W (Var.) = 4° W.</p>

<img alt="Illustration of Latitude and Longitude" src="images/fig014.jpg" width="500" height="482" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been using the words Latitude and Longitude a good deal since this course
began. Let us see just what the words mean. Before doing that, there are a few facts
to keep in mind about the earth itself. The earth is a spheroid slightly flattened
at the poles. The axis of the earth is a line running through the center of the
earth and intersecting the surface of the earth at the poles. The equator is the
great circle, formed by the intersection of the earth&#39;s surface with a plane perpendicular
to the earth&#39;s axis and equidistant from the poles. Every point on the equator is,
therefore, 90° from each pole.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg
27]</a></span></p>
<p>Meridians are great circles formed by the intersection with the earth´s surface
of planes perpendicular to the equator.</p>
<p>Parallels of latitude are small circles parallel to the equator.</p>
<p>The Latitude of a place on the surface of the earth is the arc of the meridian
intercepted between the equator and that place. It is measured by the angle running
from the equator to the center of the earth and back through the place in question.
Latitude is reckoned from the equator (0°) to the North Pole (90°) and from the
equator (0°) to the South Pole (90°). The difference of Latitude between any two
places is the arc of the meridian intercepted between the parallels of Latitude
of the places and is marked N or S according to the direction in which you steam
(T n´).</p>
<p>The Longitude of a place on the surface of the earth is the arc of the equator
intercepted between the meridian of the place and the meridian at Greenwich, England,
called the Prime Meridian. Longitude is reckoned East or West through 180° from
the Meridian at Greenwich. Difference of Longitude between any two places is the
arc of the equator intercepted between their meridians, and is called East or West
according to direction. Example: Diff. Lo. T and T´ = E´ M, and E or W according
as to which way you go.</p>
<p>Departure is the actual linear distance measured on a parallel of Latitude
between two meridians. Difference of Latitude is reckoned in minutes because
miles and minutes of Latitude are always the same. Departure, however, is only
reckoned in <em>miles</em>,
because while a mile is equal to 1´ of longitude on the equator, it is equal to
more than 1´ as the latitude increases; the reason being, of course, that the meridians
of Lo. converge toward the pole, and the distance between the same two meridians
grows less and less as you leave the equator and go toward either pole. Example:
TN, N´n´. 10 mi. departure on the equator = 10´ difference in Lo. 10 mi. departure
in Lat. 55° equals something like 18´ difference in Lo.</p>
<p>The curved line which joins any two places on the earth´s surface, cutting all
the meridians at the same angle, is called the Rhumb Line. The angle which this
line makes with the meridian of Lo. intersecting any point in question is the Course,
and the length of the line between any two places is called the distance between
them. Example: T or T´.</p>
<p class="center"><em>Chart Projections</em></p>
<p>The earth is projected, so to speak, upon a chart in three different ways - the
Mercator Projection, the Polyconic Projection and the Gnomonic Projection.</p>
<p class="center"><em>The Mercator Projection</em></p>
<p>You already know something about the Mercator Projection and a Mercator chart.
As explained before, it is constructed on the theory that the earth is a cylinder
instead of a sphere. The meridians of longitude, therefore, run parallel instead
of converging, and the parallels of latitude are lengthened out to correspond to
the widening out of the Lo. meridians. Just how this Mercator chart is constructed
is explained in detail in the Arts. in Bowditch you were given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg
28]</a></span> read last night. You do not have to actually construct such a chart,
as the Government has for sale blank Mercator charts for every parallel of latitude
in which they can be used. It is well to remember, however, that since a mile or
minute of latitude has a different value in every latitude, there is an appearance
of distortion in every Mercator chart which covers any large extent of surface.
For instance, an island near the pole, will be represented as being much larger
than one of the same size near the equator, due to the different scale used to preserve
the accurate character of the projection.</p>
<p class="center"><em>The Polyconic Projection</em></p>
<p>The theory of the Polyconic Projection is based upon conceiving the earth´s surface
as a series of cones, each one having the parallel as its base and its vertex in
the point where a tangent to the earth at that latitude intersects the earth´s axis.
The degrees of latitude and longitude on this chart are projected in their true
length and the general distortion of the earth´s surface is less than in any other
method of projection.</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Polyconic Projection" src="images/fig015.jpg" width="500" height="448" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>A straight line on the polyconic chart represents a near approach to a great
circle, making a slightly different angle with each meridian of longitude as they
converge toward the poles. The parallels of latitude are also shown as curved lines,
this being apparent on all but large scale charts. The Polyconic Projection is especially
adapted to surveying, but is also employed to some extent in charts of the U. S.
Coast &amp; Geodetic Survey.</p>
<p class="center"><em>Gnomonic Projection</em></p>
<p>The theory of this projection is to make a curved line appear and be a straight
line on the chart, i.e., as though you were at the center of the earth and looking
out toward the circumference. The Gnomonic Projection is of particular value in
sailing long distance courses where following a curved line over the earth´s surface
is the shortest distance between two points that are widely separated. This is called
Great Circle Sailing and will be talked about in more detail later on. The point
to remember here is that the Hydrographic Office prints Great Circle Sailing Charts
covering all the navigable waters of the globe. Since all these charts are constructed
on the Gnomonic Projection, it is only necessary to join any two points by a straight
line to get the <em>curved</em> line or great circle track which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg
29]</a></span> your ship is to follow. The courses to sail and the distance between
each course are easily ascertained from the information on the chart. This is the
way it is done:</p>
<p>(Note to Instructor: Provide yourself with a chart and explain from the chart
explanation just how these courses are laid down.)</p>
<p>Spend the rest of the time in having pupils lay down courses on the different
kinds of charts. If these charts are not available assign for night work the following
articles in Bowditch, part of which reading can be done immediately in the class
room - so that as much time as possible can be given to the reading on Dead Reckoning:
167-168-169-172-173-174-175-176 - first two sentences 178-202-203-204-205-206-207-208.</p>
<p>Note to pupils: In reading articles 167-178, disregard the formulæ and the examples
worked out by logarithms. Just try to get a clear idea of the different sailings
mentioned and the theory of Dead Reckoning in Arts. 202-209.</p>

<h3><a name="WEDNESDAY_LECTURE_II" id="WEDNESDAY_LECTURE_II"></a>WEDNESDAY LECTURE</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Useful Tables&#8212;Plane And Traverse Sailing</span></h4>
<p>The whole subject of Navigation is divided into two parts, i.e., finding your
position by what is called Dead Reckoning and finding your position by observation
of celestial bodies such as the sun, stars, planets, etc.</p>
<p>To find your position by dead reckoning, you go on the theory that small sections
of the earth are flat. The whole affair then simply resolves itself into solving
the length of right-angled triangles except, of course, when you are going due East
and West or due North and South. For instance, any courses you sail like these will
be the hypotenuses of a series of right-angled triangles. The problem you have to
solve is, having left a point on land, the latitude and longitude of which you know,
and sailed so many miles in a certain direction, in what latitude and longitude
have you arrived?</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Dead Reckoning Illustration" src="images/fig016.jpg" width="500" height="221" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you sail due North or South, the problem is merely one of arithmetic. Suppose
your position at noon today is Latitude 39° 15&#39; N, Longitude 40° W, and up to noon
tomorrow you steam due North 300 miles. Now you have already learned that a minute
of latitude is always equal to a nautical mile. Hence, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg
30]</a></span> have sailed 300 minutes of latitude or 5°. This 5° is called difference
of latitude, and as you are in North latitude and going North, the difference of
latitude, 5°, should be added to the latitude left, making your new position 44°
15&#39; N and your Longitude the same 40° W, since you have not changed your longitude
at all.</p>
<p>In sailing East or West, however, your problem is more difficult. Only on the
equator is a minute of longitude and a nautical mile of the same length. As the
meridians of longitude converge toward the poles, the lengths between each lessen.
We now have to rely on tables to tell us the number of miles in a degree of longitude
at every distance North or South of the equator, i.e., in every latitude. Longitude,
then, is reckoned in <em>miles</em>. The number of miles a ship makes East or West is called
Departure, and it must be converted into degrees, minutes and seconds to find the
difference of longitude.</p>
<p>A ship, however, seldom goes due North or South or due East or West. She usually
steams a diagonal course. Suppose, for instance, a vessel in Latitude 40° 30&#39; N,
Longitude 70° 25&#39; W, sails SSW 50 miles. What is the new latitude and longitude
she arrives in? She sails a course like this:</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Course SSW" src="images/fig017.jpg" width="500" height="237" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now suppose we draw a perpendicular line to represent a meridian of longitude
and a horizontal one to represent a parallel of latitude. Then we have a right-angled
triangle in which the line AC represents the course and distance sailed, and the
angle at A is the angle of the course with a meridian of longitude. If we can ascertain
the length of AB, or the distance South the ship has sailed, we shall have the difference
of latitude, and if we can get the length of the line BC, we shall have the Departure
and from it the difference of longitude. This is a simple problem in trigonometry,
i.e., knowing the angle and the length of one side of a right triangle, what is
the length of the other two sides? But you do not have to use trigonometry. The
whole problem is worked out for you in Table 2 of Bowditch. Find the angle of the
course SSW, i.e., S 22° W in the old or 202° in the new compass reading. Look down
the distance column to the left for the distance sailed, i.e., 50 miles. Opposite
this you find the difference of latitude 46-4/10 (46.4) and the departure 18-7/10
(18.7). Now the position we were in at the start was Lat. 40° 30&#39; N, Longitude 70°
25&#39; W. In sailing SSW 50 miles, we made a difference of latitude of 46&#39; 24&quot; (46.4),
and as we went South - toward the equator - we should subtract this 46&#39; 24&quot; from our
latitude left to give us our latitude in.</p>
<p>Now we must find our difference of longitude and from it the new or Longitude
in. The first thing to do is to find the <em>average</em> or middle latitude in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg
31]</a></span> you have been sailing. Do this by adding the latitude left and the
latitude in and dividing by 2.</p>
<table style="width: 100%" id="table5">

<p>Take the nearest degree, i.e., 40°, as your answer. With this 40° enter the same
Table 2 and look for your departure, i.e., 18.7 in the <em>difference of latitude</em>
column. 18.4 is the nearest to it. Now look to the left in the distance column opposite
18.4 and you will find 24, which means that in Lat. 40° a departure of 18.7 miles
is equivalent to 24&#39; of difference of Longitude. We were in 70° 25&#39; West Longitude
and we sailed South and West, so this difference of Longitude should be added to
the Longitude left to get the Longitude in:</p>
<table style="width: 100%" id="table6">

<p>There is one more fact to explain. When the course is 45° or less (old compass
reading) you read from the top of the page of Table 2 down. When the course is more
than 45° (old compass reading) you read from the bottom of the page up. The distance
is taken out in exactly the same way in both cases, but the difference of Latitude
and the Departure, you will notice, are reversed. (Instructor: Read a few courses
to thoroughly explain this.) From all this explanation we get the following rules,
which put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>To find the new or Lat. in: Enter Table 2 with the true course at the top or
bottom of the page according as to whether it is less or greater than 45° (old compass
reading). Take out the difference of Latitude and Departure and mark the difference
of Latitude minutes (&#39;). When the Latitude left and the difference of Latitude are
both North or both South, add them. When one is North and the other South, subtract
the less from the greater and the remainder, named North or South after the greater,
will be the new Latitude, known as the Latitude in.</p>
<p>To find the new or Lo. in: Find the middle latitude by adding the latitude left
to the latitude in and dividing by 2. With this middle latitude, enter Table 2.
Seek for the departure in the difference of latitude column. Opposite to it in the
distance column will be the figures indicating the number of minutes in the difference
of longitude. With this difference of Longitude, apply it in the same way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg
32]</a></span> to the Longitude left as you applied the difference of Latitude to
the Latitude left. The result will be the new or Longitude in.</p>
<p>Now if a ship steamed a whole day on the same course, you would be able to get
her Dead Reckoning position without any further work, but a ship does not usually
sail the same course 24 hours straight. She usually changes her course several times,
and as a ship&#39;s position by D.R. is only computed once a day - at noon - it becomes
necessary to have a method of obtaining the result after several courses have been
sailed. This is called working a traverse and sailing on various courses in this
fashion is called Traverse Sailing.</p>
<p>Put in your Note-Book the following example and the way in which it is worked:</p>
<p>Departure taken from Barnegat Light in Lat. 39° 46&#39; N, Lo. 74° 06&#39; W, bearing
by compass NNW, 15 knots away. Ship heading South with a Deviation of 4° W. She
sailed on the following courses:</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Courses Sailed" src="images/img01.jpg" width="668" height="100" />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Calculations" src="images/img02.jpg" width="700" height="372" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rule covering all these operations is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Write out the various courses with their corrections for Leeway, Deviation,
Variation and the distance run on each.</p>
<p>2. In four adjoining columns headed N, S, E, W respectively, put down the Difference
of Latitude and Departure for each course.</p>
<p>3. Add together all the northings, all the southings, all the eastings and all
the westings. Subtract to find the difference between northings and southings and
you will get the whole difference of Latitude. The difference between the eastings
and westings will be the whole departure.</p>
<p>4. Find the latitude in, as already explained.</p>
<p>5. Find the Lo. in, as already explained.</p>
<p>6. With the whole difference of Latitude and whole Departure, seek in Table 2
for the page where the nearest agreement of Difference of Latitude and Departure
can be found. The number of degrees at the top or bottom of the page (according
as to whether the Diff. of Lat. or Dep. is greater) will give you the true course
made good, and the number in the distance column opposite the proper Difference
of Latitude and Departure will give you the distance made.</p>
<p>It is often convenient to use the reverse of the above method, i.e., being given
the latitude and longitude of the position left and the latitude and longitude of
the position arrived in, to find the course and distance between them by Middle
Latitude Sailing. The full rule is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Find the algebraic difference between the latitudes and longitudes respectively.</p>
<p>2. Using the middle (or average) latitude as a course, find in Table 2 of Bowditch
the Diff. of Lo. in the distance column. Opposite, in the Diff. of Lat. column,
will be the correct Departure.</p>
<p>3. With the Diff. of Lat. between the position left and the position arrived
in, and the Departure, just secured, seek in Table 2 for the page where the nearest
agreement to these values can be found. On this page will be secured the true course
and distance made, as explained in the preceding method.</p>
<p>4. Use this method only when steaming approximately an East and West course.</p>
<p>For an example of this method, see Bowditch, p. 77, example 3.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Mercator Sailing</span></h4>
<p>This is a method to find the true course and distance between two points. The
method can be used in two ways, i.e., by the use of Tables 2 and 3 (called the inspection
method) and by the use of logarithms. The first method is the quicker and will do
for short distances. The second method, however, is more accurate in all cases,
and particularly where the distances are great. The inspection method is as follows
(Put in your Note-Book):</p>
<p>Find the algebraic difference between the meridional parts corresponding to the
Lat. in and Lat. sought by Table 3. Call this Meridional difference of Latitude.
Find the algebraic difference between Longitude in and Longitude sought and call
this difference of Longitude. With the Meridional difference of Latitude and the
difference of Longitude, find the course by searching in Table 2 for the page
where they stand opposite each other in the latitude and departure columns. Now
find the real difference of latitude. Under the course just found and opposite
the <em>real</em>
difference of Latitude, will be found the distance sailed in the distance column.
Example:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>On page 604 Bowditch you will find 48.7 and 64.7 opposite each other, and as
48.7 is in the Lat. column only when you read from the bottom, the course is S 53°
E. The real difference of Lat. under this course is opposite 62 in the distance
column. Hence the distance to be sailed is 62 miles.</p>
<p>If distances are too great, divide meridional difference of Lat., real difference
of Latitude and difference of Longitude by 10 or any other number to bring them
within the scope of the distances in Table 2. When distance to be sailed is found,
it must be multiplied by the same number. For instance, if the difference of Lat.,
difference of Lo., etc., are divided by 10 to bring them in the scope of Table 2,
and with these figures 219 is the distance found, the real distance would be 10
times 219 or 2190.</p>

<p>Find algebraically the real difference of latitude, meridional difference of
latitude and the difference of longitude. Reduce real difference of latitude and
difference of longitude to minutes. Take log of the difference of longitude (Table
42) and add 10. From this log subtract the log of difference of meridional parts.
The result will be the log tan of the True Course, which find in Table 44. On the
same page find the log sec of true course. Add to this the log of the real difference
of latitude, and if the result is more than 10, subtract 10. This result will be
the log of the distance sailed. This method should be used only when steaming approximately
a North and South course.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Great Circle Sailing&#8212;the Chronometer</span></h4>
<p>In Tuesday&#39;s Lecture of this week, I explained how a Great Circle track was laid
down on one of the Great Circle Sailing Charts which are prepared by the Hydrographic
Office.</p>
<p>Supposing, however, you do not have these charts on hand. There is an easy way
to construct a great circle track yourself. Turn to Art. 194, page 82, in Bowditch.
Here is a table with an explanation as to how to use it. Take, for instance, the
same two points between which you just drew a line on the great circle track. Find
the center of this line and the latitude of that point. At this point draw a line
perpendicular to the course to be sailed, the other end of which must intersect
the corresponding parallel of latitude given in the table. With this point as the
center of a circle, sweep an arc which will intersect the point left and the point
sought. This arc will be the great circle track to follow.</p>
<p>To find the courses to be sailed, get the difference between the course at starting
and that at the middle of the circle, and find how many quarter points are contained
in it. Now divide the distance from the starting point to the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg
37]</a></span> of the circle by the number of quarter points. That will give the
number of miles to sail on each quarter point course. See this illustration:</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Miles sailed" src="images/fig018.jpg" width="500" height="154" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Difference between ENE and E = 2 pts. = 8 quarter points. Say distance is 1600
miles measured by dividers or secured by Mercator Sailing Method. Divide 1600 by
8 = 200. Every 200 miles you should change your course ¼ point East.</p>
<p class="center"><em>The Chronometer</em></p>
<p>The chronometer is nothing more than a very finely regulated clock. With it we
ascertain Greenwich Mean Time, i.e., the mean time at Greenwich Observatory, England.
Just what the words &quot;Greenwich Mean Time&quot; signify, will be explained in more detail
later on. What you should remember here is that practically every method of finding
your exact position at sea is dependent upon knowing Greenwich Mean Time, and the
only way to find it is by means of the chronometer.</p>
<p>It is essential to keep the chronometer as quiet as possible. For that reason,
when you take an observation you will probably note the time by your watch. Just
before taking the observation, you will compare your watch with the chronometer
to notice the exact difference between the two. When you take your observation,
note the watch time, apply the difference between the chronometer and watch, and
the result will be the CT.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose the chronometer read 3h 25m 10s, and your watch, at the
same instant, read 1h 10m 5s. C-W would be:</p>
<table id="table10">

<p>There is one more very important fact to know about the chronometer. It is physically
impossible to keep it absolutely accurate over a long period of time. Instead of
continually fussing with its adjustment and hands, the daily rate of error is ascertained,
and from this the exact time for any given day. It is an invariable practice among
good mariners to <em>leave the chronometer alone</em>. When you are in port, you can find
out from a time ball or from some chronometer maker what your error is. With this
in mind, you can apply the new correction from day to day. Here is an example (Put
in your Note-Book):</p>
<p>On June 1st, CT 7h&nbsp;&nbsp; 20m&nbsp;&nbsp; 15s, CC 2m&nbsp;&nbsp; 40s fast. On June 16th, (same CT) CC 1m&nbsp;&nbsp; 30s

<h4><span class="smcap">Celestial Co-ordinates, Equinoctial System, Etc.</span></h4>
<p>We have already discussed the way in which the earth is divided so as to aid
us in finding our position at sea, i.e., with an equator, parallels of latitude,
meridians of longitude starting at the Greenwich meridian, etc. We now take up the
way in which the celestial sphere is correspondingly divided and also simple explanations
of some of the more important terms used in Celestial Navigation.</p>
<p>As you stand on any point of the earth and look up, the heavenly bodies appear
as though they were situated upon the surface of a vast hollow sphere, of which
your eye is the center. Of course this apparent concave vault has no existence and
we cannot accurately measure the distance of the heavenly bodies from us or from
each other. We can, however, measure the direction of some of these bodies and that
information is of tremendous value to us in helping us to fix our position.</p>
<p>Now we could use our eye as the center of the celestial sphere but more accurate
than that is to use the center of the earth. Suppose we do use the center of the
earth as the place from which to observe these celestial bodies and, in imagination,
transfer our eye there. Then we will find projected on the celestial sphere not
only the heavenly bodies but the imaginary points and circles of the earth&#39;s surface.
Parallels of latitude, meridians of longitude, the equator, etc., will have the
same imaginary position on the celestial sphere that they have on the earth. Your
actual position on the earth will be projected in a point called your zenith, i.e.,
the point directly overhead.</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="The Celestial Sphere" src="images/fig019.jpg" width="500" height="441" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>From this we get the definition that the Zenith of an observer on the earth&#39;s
surface is the point in the celestial sphere directly overhead.</p>
<p>It would be a simple matter to fix your position if your position never changed.
But it is always changing with relation to these celestial bodies. First, the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg
41]</a></span> is revolving on its own axis. Second, the earth is moving in an elliptic
track around the sun, and third, certain celestial bodies themselves are moving
in a track of their own. The changes produced by the daily rotation of the earth
on its axis are different for observers at different points on the earth and, therefore,
depend upon the latitude and longitude of the observer. But the changes arising
from the earth&#39;s motion in its orbit and the motion of various celestial bodies
in their orbits, are true no matter on what point of the earth you happen to be.
These changes, therefore, in their relation to the center of the earth, may be accurately
gauged at any instant. To this end the facts necessary for any calculation have
been collected and are available in the Nautical Almanac, which we will take up
in more detail later.</p>
<p>Now with these facts in mind, let us explain in simple words the meaning of some
of the terms you will have to become acquainted with in Celestial Navigation.</p>
<p>In the illustration (Bowditch p. 88) the earth is supposed to be projected upon
the celestial sphere N E S W. The Zenith of the observer is projected at Z and the
pole of the earth which is above the horizon is projected at P. The other pole is
not given.</p>
<p>The Celestial Equator is marked here E Q W and like all other points and lines
previously mentioned, it is the projection of the Equator until it intersects the
celestial sphere. Another name for the Celestial Equator is the Equinoctial.</p>
<p>All celestial meridians of longitude corresponding to longitude meridians on
the earth are perpendicular to the equinoctial and likewise P S, the meridian of
the observer, since it passes through the observer&#39;s zenith at Z, is formed by the
extension of the earth&#39;s meridian of the observer and hence intersects the horizon
at its N and S points. This makes clear again just what is the meridian of the observer.
It is the meridian of longitude which passes through the N and S poles and the observer&#39;s
zenith. In other words, when the sun or any other heavenly body is on your meridian,
a line stretched due N and S, intersecting the N and S poles, will pass through
your zenith and the center of the sun or other celestial body. To understand this
is important, for no sight with the sextant is of value except with relation to
your meridian.</p>
<p>The Declination of any point in the celestial sphere is its distance in arc,
North or South of the celestial equator, i.e., N or S of the Equinoctial.</p>
<p>North declinations, i.e., declinations north of the equinoctial are always marked,
+; those south of the equinoctial, -. For instance, in the Nautical Almanac, you
will never see a declination of the sun or other celestial body marked, N 18° 28&#39;
30&quot;. It will always be marked +18° 28&#39; 30&quot; and a south declination will be marked
-18° 28&#39; 30&quot;. Another fact to remember is that Declination on the celestial sphere
corresponds to latitude on the earth. If, for instance, the Sun&#39;s declination is
+18° 28&#39; 30&quot; at noon, Greenwich, then at that instant, i.e., noon at Greenwich,
the sun will be directly overhead a point on earth which is in latitude N 18° 28&#39;
30&quot;.</p>
<p>The Polar Distance of any point is its distance in arc from either pole. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg
42]</a></span> must, therefore, equal 90° minus the declination, if measured from
the pole of the same name as the declination or 90° plus the declination if measured
from the pole of the opposite name.</p>
<p>P M is the polar distance of M from P, or P B the polar distance of B from P.</p>
<p>The true altitude of a celestial body is its angular height from the true horizon.</p>
<p>The zenith distance of any point or celestial body is its angular distance from
the zenith of the observer.</p>
<p>The Ecliptic is the great circle representing the path in which the sun appears
to move in the celestial sphere. As a matter of fact, you know that the earth moves
around the sun, but as you observe the sun from some spot on the earth, it appears
to move around the earth. This apparent track is called the Ecliptic as stated before,
and in the illustration the Ecliptic is represented by the curved line, C V T. The
plane of the Ecliptic is inclined to that of the Equinoctial at an angle of 23°
27½&#39;, and this inclination is called the obliquity of the Ecliptic.</p>
<p>The Equinoxes are those points at which the Ecliptic and Equinoctial intersect,
and when the sun occupies either of these two positions, the days and nights are
of equal length. The Vernal Equinox is that one which the sun passes through or
intersects in going from S to N declination, and the Autumnal Equinox that which
it passes through or intersects in going from N to S declination. The Vernal Equinox
(V in the illustration) is also designated as the First Point of Aries which is
of use in reckoning star time and will be mentioned in more detail later.</p>
<p>The Solstitial Points, or Solstices, are points of the Ecliptic at a distance
of 90° from the Equinoxes, at which the sun attains its highest declination in each
hemisphere. They are called the Summer and Winter Solstice according to the season
in which the sun appears to pass these points in its path.</p>
<p>To sum up: The way to find any point on the earth is to find the distance of
this point N or S of the equator (i.e., its Latitude) and its distance E or W of
the meridian at Greenwich (i.e., its longitude). In the celestial sphere, the way
to find the location of a point or celestial body such as the sun is to find its
declination (i.e., distance in arc N or S of the equator) and its hour angle. By
hour angle, I mean the distance in time from your meridian to the meridian of the
point or celestial body in question.</p>

<h3><a name="WEDNESDAY_LECTURE_III" id="WEDNESDAY_LECTURE_III"></a>WEDNESDAY LECTURE</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Time By The Sun&#8212;Mean Time, Solar Time, Conversion, Etc.</span></h4>
<p>There is nothing more important in all Navigation than the subject of Time. Every
calculation for determining the position of your ship at sea must take into consideration
some kind of time. Put in your Note-Book:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg
43]</a></span></p>
<p>There are three kinds of time:</p>
<p>1. Apparent or solar time, i.e., time by the sun.</p>
<p>2. Mean Time, i.e., clock time.</p>
<p>3. Sidereal Time, or time by the stars.</p>
<p>So far as this lecture is concerned, we will omit any mention of sidereal time,
i.e., time by the stars. We will devote this morning to sun time, i.e., apparent
time, and mean time.</p>
<p>Apparent or Solar Time is, as stated before, nothing more than sun time or time
by the sun. The hour angle of the center of the sun is the measure of apparent or
solar time. An apparent or solar day is the interval of time it takes for the earth
to revolve completely around on its axis every 24 hours. It is apparent noon at
the place where you are when the center of the sun is directly on your meridian,
i.e., on the meridian of longitude which runs through the North and South poles
and also intersects your zenith. This is the most natural and the most accurate
measure of time for the navigator at sea and the unit of time adopted by the mariner
is the apparent solar day. Apparent noon is the time when the latitude of your position
can be most easily and most exactly determined and on the latitude by observation
just secured we can get data which will be of great value to us for longitude sights
taken later in the day.</p>
<p>Now it would be very easy for the mariner if he could measure apparent time directly
so that his clock or other instrument would always tell him just what the sun time
was. It is impossible, however, to do this because the earth does not revolve at
a uniform rate of speed. Consequently the sun is sometimes a little ahead and sometimes
a little behind any average time. You cannot manufacture a clock which will run
that way because the hours of a clock must be all of exactly the same length and
it must make noon at precisely 12 o&#39;clock every day. Hence we distinguish clock
time from sun time by calling clock time, mean (or average) time and sun time, apparent
or solar time. From this explanation you are ready to understand such expressions
as Local Mean Time, which, in untechnical language, signifies clock time at the
place where you are; Greenwich Mean Time which signifies clock time at Greenwich;
Local Apparent Time, which signifies sun time at the place where you are; Greenwich
Apparent Time, which signifies sun time at Greenwich.</p>
<p>Now the difference between apparent time and mean time can be found for any minute
of the day by reference to the Nautical Almanac which we will take up later in more
detail. This difference is called the Equation of Time.</p>
<p>There is one more fact to remember in regard to apparent and mean time. It is
the relation of the sun&#39;s hour angle to apparent time. In the first place, what
is a definition of the sun&#39;s HA? It is the angle at the celestial pole between the
meridian intersecting any given point and the meridian intersecting the center of
the sun. It is measured by the arc of the celestial equator intersected between
the meridian of any point and the meridian intersecting the center of the sun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg
44]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Hour Angle of Greenwich" src="images/fig020.jpg" width="494" height="500" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, in the above diagram, suppose PG is the meridian at Greenwich,
and PS the meridian intersecting the sun. Then the angle at the pole GPS, measured
by the arc GS would be the Hour Angle of Greenwich, or the Greenwich Hour Angle.
And now you notice that this angular measure is exactly the same as apparent time
at Greenwich or Greenwich Apparent Time, for Greenwich Apparent Time is nothing
more than the distance in time Greenwich, England, or the meridian at Greenwich
is from the sun, i.e., the time it takes the earth to revolve from Greenwich to
the sun; and that distance is exactly measured by the Greenwich Hour Angle or the
arc on the celestial equator, GS.</p>
<p>The same is correspondingly true of Local Apparent Time and the ship&#39;s Hour Angle.
Suppose, for instance, PL is the meridian intersecting the place where your ship
is. Then your ship&#39;s hour angle would be the angle at the pole intersecting the
meridian of your ship and the meridian of the sun or LPS and measured by the arc
LS. And you will note that this distance is exactly the same as apparent time at
the ship, for Apparent Time at ship is nothing more than the distance in time which
the ship is from the sun. We can sum up all this information in a few simple rules,
which put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>Mean Time = Clock Time.</p>
<p>G.M.T. = Greenwich Mean Time.</p>
<p>L.M.T. = Local Mean Time.</p>
<p>Apparent Time = Actual or Sun Time.</p>
<p>G.A.T. (G.H.A.) = Greenwich Apparent Time or Greenwich Hour Angle.</p>
<p>L.A.T. (S.H.A.) = Local Apparent Time or Ship&#39;s Hour Angle.</p>
<p>Difference between apparent and mean time or mean and apparent time - Equation
of Time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<p>Right under this in your Note-Book put the following diagram, which I will explain:</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Twelve and Twentyfour Hour Clocks" src="images/fig021.jpg" width="500" height="495" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will see from this diagram that civil time commences at midnight and runs
through 12 hours to noon. It then commences again and runs through 12 hours to midnight.
The Civil Day, then, is from midnight to midnight, divided into two periods of 12
hours each.</p>
<p>The astronomical day commences at noon of the civil day of the same date. It
comprises 24 hours, reckoned from O to 24, from noon of one day to noon of the next.
Astronomical time, either apparent or mean, is the hour angle of the true or mean
sun respectively, measured to the westward throughout its entire daily circuit.</p>
<p>Since the civil day begins 12 hours before the astronomical day and ends 12 hours
before it, A.M. of a new civil day is P.M. of the astronomical day preceding. For
instance, 6 hours A.M., April 15th civil time is equivalent to 18 hours April 14th,
astronomical time.</p>
<p>Now, all astronomical calculations in which time is a necessary fact to be known,
must be expressed in astronomical time. As chronometers have their face marked only
from 0 to 12 as in the case of an ordinary watch, it is necessary to transpose this
watch or chronometer time into astronomical time. No transposing is necessary if
the time is P.M., as you can see from the diagram that both civil and astronomical
times up to 12 P.M. are the same. But in A.M. time, such transposing is necessary.
Put in your Note-Book:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<p>Whenever local or chronometer time is A.M., deduct 12 hours from such time to
get the correct astronomical time:</p>

<p>Now we come to a very important application of time. You will remember that in
one of the former lectures we stated that to find our latitude, we had to find how
far North or South of the equator we were, and to find our longitude, we had to
find how far East or West of the meridian at Greenwich we were. Never mind about
latitude for the present. We can find our longitude exactly if we know our Greenwich
time and our time at ship. For instance, in the accompanying diagram:</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="East and West Longitude" src="images/fig022.jpg" width="400" height="336" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suppose PG is the meridian at Greenwich, then anything to the west of PG is West
longitude and anything to the East of PG is East longitude. Now suppose GPS is the
H.A. of G. or G.A.T. - i.e., the distance in time G. is from the sun. And L P S is
the H.A. of the ship or L.A.T. - i.e., the distance in time the ship is from the sun.
Then the difference between G P S and L P S is G P L, measured by the arc L G, and
that is the difference that the ship, represented by its meridian PL, is from the
Greenwich meridian PG. In other words, that is the ship&#39;s longitude for, as mentioned
before, longitude is the distance East or West of Greenwich that any point is, measured
on the arc of the celestial equator. The longitude is West, for you can see LPG
or the arc LG is west of the meridian PG.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg
47]</a></span></p>
<p>Likewise if P E is the meridian of your ship, the Longitude in time is the S.H.A.
or L.A.T., E P S (the distance your ship is from the sun) less the G.H.A. or G.A.T.,
G P S (the distance Greenwich is from the sun) which is the angle G P E measured
by the arc G E. And this Longitude is East for you can see G P E, measured by G
E, is east of the Greenwich meridian, P G.</p>
<p>In both these cases, however, the longitude is expressed in time, i.e., so many
hours, minutes and seconds from the Greenwich meridian and we wish to express this
distance in degrees, minutes and seconds of arc. The earth describes a circle of
360° every 24 hours. Then if you are 1 hour from Greenwich, you are 1/24 of 360°
or 15° from Greenwich and if you are 12 hours from Greenwich, you are ½ of 360°
or 180° from Greenwich. By keeping this in mind, you should be able to transpose
time into degrees, minutes and seconds of arc for any fraction of time. It is, however,
all worked out in Table 7 of Bowditch which turn to. (Note to Instructor: Explain
this table carefully). Put in your Note-Book:</p>

<h3><a name="THURSDAY_LECTURE_III" id="THURSDAY_LECTURE_III"></a>THURSDAY LECTURE</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Sidereal Time&#8212;Right Ascension</span></h4>
<p>Our last lecture was devoted to a discussion of sun time. Today we are going
to talk about star time, or, using the more common words, sidereal time.</p>
<p>Now, just one word of review. You remember that we have learned that astronomical
time is reckoned from noon of one day to noon of the next and hence the astronomical
day corresponds to the 24 hours of a ship&#39;s run. The hours are counted from 0 to
24, so that 10 o&#39;clock in the morning of October 25th is astronomically October
24th, 22 hours or 22 o&#39;clock of October 24th.</p>
<p>Now Right Ascension is different from both astronomical and civil time. Right
Ascension is practically celestial longitude. For instance, the position of a place
on the earth is fixed by its latitude and longitude; the position of a heavenly
body is fixed by its declination and right ascension. But Right Ascension is not
measured in degrees and minutes nor is it measured East and West. It is reckoned
in hours and minutes all the way around the sky, eastward from a certain point,
through the approximate 24 hours. The point from which this celestial longitude
begins is not at Greenwich, but the point where the celestial equator intersects
the ecliptic in the spring of the year, i.e., the point where the sun, coming North
in the Spring, crosses the celestial equator. This point is called the First Point
of Aries. You will frequently hear me speak of a star having, for instance, a Right
Ascension of 5h 16m 32s. I mean by that, that starting at the celestial meridian,
i.e., the meridian passing through the First Point of Aries, it will take a spot
on the earth 5h 16m 32s to travel until it reaches the meridian of the star in question.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking then, just as Greenwich Apparent Time means the distance East
or West the Greenwich meridian is from the sun and Local Apparent Time means the
distance East or West your ship is from the sun, so R.A.M.G. means the distance
in time the Meridian of Greenwich is from the First Point of Aries, measured eastward
in a circle. And this distance is the same as Greenwich Sidereal Time, i.e., Sidereal
Time at Greenwich or the distance in time the meridian of Greenwich is from the
First Point of Aries.</p>
<p>Now, what is the star time that corresponds to local time? It is called the Right
Ascension of the Meridian, which means the R. A. of the meridian which intersects
your zenith. Just as L.A.T. is the distance in time your meridian is from the sun,
so Local Sidereal Time is the R. A. of your meridian, i.e., the distance in time
your meridian is from the First Point of Aries. Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">G.S.T. and R.A.M.G. are one and the same thing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">L.S.T. and R.A.M. are one and the same thing.</span><br />

</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p>I can explain all these formulas very easily by the following illustration which
put in your Note-Book: (Note to Instructor: If possible have copies of this illustration
mimeographed and distributed to each student.)</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="First Point of Aries" src="images/fig023.jpg" width="500" height="518" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is one term I have used which does not appear in the illustration. It is
the Earth&#39;s Central Progress (<span><img alt="Circle enclosing a Cross" src="images/circlecross.jpg" width="17" height="18" class="style10" />.C.P.</span>). The astronomical day based on the sun,
is 24 hours long, as said before. The sidereal day, however, is only 23h 56m 04s
long. This is due to the fact that whereas the earth is moving in its ecliptic track
around the sun while revolving on its own axis, the First Point of Aries is a fixed
point and hence never moves. The correction, then, for the difference in the length
of time between a sidereal day and a mean solar day is called the Earth&#39;s Central
Progress and, of course, has to be figured for all amounts of time after mean noon
at Greenwich, since the Sun&#39;s Right Ascension tables in the Nautical Almanac are
based on time at mean noon at Greenwich.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg

<p>Now you have a formula for practically all kinds of conversion except for converting
L.M.T. into L.S.T. You could do it by the formula</p>
<p>L.M.T. + W.Lo. = G.M.T. +

<p>The small difference between this answer and that of Bowditch&#39;s is that the
<span>
<img alt="Circle enclosing dot" src="images/circledot.jpg" width="17" height="18" class="style10" />.R.A.</span>
for 1916 is slightly different from that of 1919. Bowditch used the 1916 Almanac,
whereas we are working from the 1919 Almanac. Now turn to page 107 of the N.A. and
let us work the same example in Bowditch by the method used here:</p>

<p>The reason I am going so much into detail in explaining methods of finding L.S.T.
is because, by a very simple calculation which will be explained later, we can get
our latitude at night if we know the altitude of Polaris (The North Star) and if
we know the L.S.T. at the time of observation. Some of you may think that the N.A.
way is the simplest. It is given in the N.A., and in an examination it would be
permissible for you to use the N.A. as a guide because, in an examination, I propose
to let you have at hand the same books you would have in the chart house of a ship.
On the other hand, the method given in the N.A. is not as clear to my mind as the
method which starts with L.M.T., then finds with the Longitude the G.M.T. That gives
you, roughly speaking, the distance in time Greenwich is from the sun. Add to that
the sun&#39;s R.A. or the distance in time the sun is from the First Point of Aries
at Greenwich Mean Noon. Add to that the correction for the time past noon. The result
is G.S.T. Now all you have to do is to apply the longitude correctly to find the
L.S.T., just as when you have G.M.T. and apply the longitude correctly you get L.M.T.
That is a method which does not seem easy to forget, for it depends more upon simple
reasoning where the others, for a beginner, depend more upon memory. However, any
of the three methods is correct and can be used by you. Perhaps the best way is
to work a problem by two of the three that seem easiest. In this way you can check
your figures. When I give you a problem that involves finding the L.S.T. I do not
care how you get the L.S.T. providing it is correct when you get it.</p>
<p>Assign for Night Reading in Bowditch the following Arts.: 282-283-284-285. Also
the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Given the G.M.T. and the longitude in T which is W, what is the formula for
L.S.T.?</p>
<p>2. Given the L.A.T. and longitude in T which is E, what is the formula for G.S.T.?</p>
<p>3. Given the L.S.T. and longitude in T which is W. Required G.M.T. </p>

<h3><a name="FRIDAY_LECTURE_III" id="FRIDAY_LECTURE_III"></a>FRIDAY LECTURE</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Nautical Almanac</span></h4>
<p>For the last two days we have been discussing Time - sun time or solar time and
star time or sidereal time. Now let us examine the Nautical Almanac to see how that
time is registered and how we read the various kinds of time for any instant of
the day or night. Before starting in, put a large cross on pages 4 and 5. For any
calculations you are going to make, these pages are unnecessary and they are liable
to lead to confusion.</p>
<p>Sun time of the mean sun at Greenwich is given for every minute of the day in
the year 1919 in the pages from 6 to 30. This is indicated by the column to the
left headed G.M.T. Turn to page 6 under Wednesday, Jan. 1st. You can see that the
even hours are given from 0 to 24. Remember that these are expressed in astronomical
time, so that if you had Jan. 2nd - 10 hours A.M., you would not look in the column
under Jan. 2nd but under the column for Jan. 1st, 22 hours, since 10 A.M. Jan. 2nd
is 22 o&#39;clock Jan. 1st, and no reading is used in this Almanac except a reading
expressed in astronomical time. Now at the bottom of the column under Jan. 1st you
see the letters H.D. That stands for &quot;hourly difference&quot; and represents the amount
to be added or subtracted for an odd hour from the nearest even hour. In this instance
it is .2. You note that even hours 2, 4, 6, etc., are given. To find an odd hour
during this astronomical day, subtract .2 from the preceding even hour. For any
fraction of an hour you simply take the corresponding fraction of the H.D. and subtract
it from the preceding even hour. For instance, the declination for Jan. 1st - 12 hours
would be 23° 1.8&#39; or 23°&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&#39;&nbsp;&nbsp; 48&quot;, 13 hours would be 23° 1.6&#39; or 23°&nbsp;1&#39;&nbsp;36&quot;, 12½ hours
would be 23° 1.7&#39; or 23°&nbsp;1&#39;&nbsp;42&quot;, and 13½ hours would be 23° 1.5&#39; or 23°&nbsp;1&#39;&nbsp;30&quot;.</p>
<p>Now to the right of the hours you note there is given the corresponding amount
of Declination and the Equation of Time. Before going further, let us review a few
facts about Declination. The declination of a celestial body is its angular distance
N or S of the celestial equator or equinoctial. Now get clearly in your mind how
we measure the angular distance from the celestial equator of any heavenly body.
It is measured by the angle one of whose sides is an imaginary line drawn to the
center of the earth and the other of whose sides is an imaginary line passing from
the center of the earth into the celestial sphere through the center of the heavenly
body whose declination you desire. Now as you stand on any part of the earth, you
are standing at right angles to the earth itself. Hence if this imaginary line passed
through you it would intersect the celestial sphere at your zenith, i.e., the point
in the celestial sphere which is directly above you. Now suppose you happen to be
standing at a certain point on the earth and suppose that point was in 15° N latitude.
And suppose at noon the center of the sun was directly over you, i.e., the center
of the sun and your zenith were one and the same point. Then the declination of
the sun at that moment would be 15° N. In other words, your angular distance from
the earth&#39;s equator (which is another way of expressing your latitude) would be
precisely the same as the angular distance of the center of the sun from the celestial
equator. Suppose you were standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg
54]</a></span> directly on the equator and the center of the sun was directly over
you, then the declination of the sun would be 0°. Now if the axis of the earth were
always perpendicular to the plane of the sun&#39;s orbit, then the sun would always
be immediately over the equator and the sun&#39;s declination would always be 0°. But
you know that the axis of the earth is inclined to the plane of the sun&#39;s orbit.
As the earth, then, revolves around the sun, the amount of the declination increases
and then decreases according to the location of the earth at any one time with relation
to the sun. On March 21st and Sept. 23rd, 1919, the sun is directly over the equator
and the declination is 0°. From March 21st to June 21st the sun is coming North
and the declination is increasing until on June 21st - 12 hours - it reaches its highest
declination. From then on the sun starts to travel South, crosses the equator on
Sept. 23d and reaches its highest declination in South latitude on Dec. 22nd, when
it starts to come North again. This explains easily the length of days. When the
sun is in North latitude, it is nearer our zenith, i.e., higher in the heavens.
It can, therefore, be seen for a longer time during the 24 hours that it takes the
earth to revolve on its axis. Hence, when the sun reaches its highest declination
in North latitude - June 21st - i.e., when it is farthest North from the equator and
nearest our zenith (which is in 40° N latitude) it can be seen for the longest length
of time. In other words, that day is the longest of the year. For the same reason,
Dec. 22nd, when the sun reaches its highest declination in South latitude, i.e.,
when it is farthest away to the South, is the shortest day in the year for us; for
on that day, the sun being farthest away from our zenith and hence lowest down toward
the horizon, can be seen for the shortest length of time.</p>
<p>Put in your Note-Book:</p>

<table id="table18">
	<tr>
		<td>North Declination is expressed +. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>South Declination is expressed&nbsp; - .</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Now turn to page 6 of the Nautical Almanac. You will see opposite Jan. 1st 0h,
a declination of&nbsp; - 23° 4.2&#39;. Every calculation in this Almanac is based on time at
Greenwich, i.e., G.M.T. So at 0h Jan. 1st at Greenwich - that is at noon - the Sun&#39;s
declination is S 23° 4.2&#39;.</p>
<p>You learned in the lecture the other day on solar time, that the difference between
mean time and apparent time was called the equation of time. This equation of time,
with the sign showing in which way it is to be applied, is given for any minute
of any day in the column marked &quot;Equation of Time.&quot; You will also notice that there
is an H.D. for equations of time just as there is for each declination, and this
H.D. should be used when finding the equation of time for an odd hour.</p>
<p>Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>1. The equation of time is to be applied as given in the Nautical Almanac when
changing Mean Time into Apparent Time.</p>
<p>2. When changing Apparent Time into Mean Time, reverse the sign as given in the
Nautical Almanac.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
<p>That is all there is to finding sun time, either mean or apparent, for any instant
of any day in the year 1919. Do not forget, however, that all this data is based
upon Greenwich Mean Time. To find Local Mean Time you must apply the Longitude you
are in. To find Local Apparent Time you must first secure G.A.T. from G.M.T. and
then apply the Longitude.</p>
<p>(Note to Instructor: Make the class work out conversions here if you have time
to do so and can finish the rest of the lecture by the end of the period.)</p>
<p>So much for time by the sun. Now let us examine time by the stars - sidereal time.
Turn to pages 2-3. There you find the Right Ascension of the Mean Sun at Greenwich
Mean Noon for every day in the year. You remember that, roughly speaking, the Sun&#39;s
Right Ascension was the distance in time the sun was from the First Point of Aries.
So these tables give that distance (expressed in time) for noon at Greenwich of
every day. For the correction to be applied for all time after noon at Greenwich
(i.e.,
<span>
<img alt="Circle enclosing a Cross" src="images/circlecross.jpg" width="17" height="18" class="style10" />.C.P.</span>), use the table at the bottom of the page. For instance, the
<span>
<img alt="Circle enclosing dot" src="images/circledot.jpg" width="17" height="18" class="style10" />.R.A.</span>
at Greenwich 9h 24m on Jan. 1st would be</p>

<p>Now we must go back to some of the formulas we learned when discussing star time
and apply them with the information we now have from the Nautical Almanac. If the
G.M.T. on April 20th is 4h&nbsp;&nbsp; 16m&nbsp;&nbsp; 30s, what is the G.S.T. for the same moment? That
is, when Greenwich is 4h&nbsp;&nbsp; 16m&nbsp;&nbsp; 30s from the sun, how far is Greenwich from the First
Point of Aries? You remember the formula was G.S.T. = G.M.T. +

<p>Suppose you were in Lo. 74° W. What would be the R.A.M. (L.S.T.)? You remember
the formula for L.S.T. from G.S.T. was the same relatively as L.M.T. from G.M.T.,
i.e., L.S.T. = G.S.T. - W. Lo.<br />

Now these are not a collection of abstruse formulas that you are learning just

<p>The last fact to know at this time about the Almanac is found on pages 94-95.
Here is given a list of the brighter stars with their positions respectively in
the heavens, i.e., their celestial longitude or R.A. on page 94 and their celestial
latitude or declination on page 95. These stars have very little apparent motion.
They are practically fixed. Hence, their position in the heavens is almost the same
from January to December though, of course, their position with relation to you
is constantly changing, since you on the earth are constantly moving.</p>
<p>The relationship between these various kinds of time is clearly expressed by

<h3><a name="SATURDAY_LECTURE_III" id="SATURDAY_LECTURE_III"></a>SATURDAY LECTURE</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Correction Of Observed Altitudes</span></h4>
<p>The true altitude of a heavenly body is the angular distance of its center as
measured from the center of the earth. The observed altitude of a heavenly body
as seen at sea by the sextant may be converted to the true altitude by the application
of the following four corrections: Dip, Refraction, Parallax and Semi-diameter.</p>
<p>Dip of the horizon means an increase in the altitude caused by the elevation
of the eye above the level of the sea. The following diagram illustrates this clearly:</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Illustration of effect of height of eye above sea level" src="images/fig025.jpg" width="500" height="293" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the eye is on the level of the sea at A, it is in the plane of the horizon
CD, and the angles EAC and EAD are right angles or 90° each. If the eye is elevated
above A, say to B, it is plain that the angles EBC and EBD are greater than right
angles, or in other words, that the observer sees more than a semi-circle of sky.
Hence all measurements made by the sextant are too large. In other words, the elevation
of the eye makes the angle too great and therefore the correction for dip is always
subtracted.</p>
<p>Refraction is a curving of the rays of light caused by their entering the earth&#39;s
atmosphere, which is a denser medium than the very light ether of the outer sky.
The effect of refraction is seen when an oar is thrust into the water and looks
as if it were bent. Refraction always causes a celestial object to appear higher
than it really is. This refraction is greatest at the horizon and diminishes toward
the zenith, where it disappears. Table 20A in Bowditch gives the correction for
mean refraction. It is always subtracted from the altitude. In the higher altitudes,
select the correction for the nearest degree.</p>
<p>You should avoid taking low altitudes (15° or less) when the atmosphere is not
perfectly clear. Haziness increases refraction.</p>
<p>Parallax is simply the difference in angular altitude of a heavenly body as measured
from the center of the earth and as measured from the corresponding point on the
surface of the earth. Parallax is greatest when the body is in the horizon, and
disappears when it is at the zenith.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg
59]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Effect of Parallax" src="images/fig026.jpg" width="500" height="248" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the angular altitude of the sun in this diagram is 0, the parallax ABC is
greatest. When the altitude is highest there is no parallax. The sun is so far away
that its parallax never exceeds 9&quot;. The stars have practically none at all from
the earth&#39;s surface. Parallax is always to be added in the case of the sun.</p>
<p>The semi-diameter of a heavenly body is half the angle subtended by the diameter
of the visible disk at the eye of the observer. For the same body, the SD varies
with the distance. Thus, the difference of the sun&#39;s SD at different times of the
year is due to the change of the earth&#39;s distance from the sun.</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Illustration of semi-diameter" src="images/fig027.jpg" width="500" height="315" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SD is to be added to the observed altitude in case the lower limb is brought
in contact with the horizon, and subtracted if the upper limb is used. Probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg
60]</a></span> most of the sights you take will be of the sun&#39;s lower limb, i.e.,
when the lower limb is brought in contact with the horizon, so all you need to remember
is that in that event the SD is additive.</p>
<p>Now at first we will correct altitudes by applying each correction separately,
but as soon as you get the idea, there is a short way to apply all four corrections
at once. This is done in Table 46. However, disregard that for the moment. Put this
in your Note-Book:</p>

<p>Remember that before an observation is at all accurate, it must be corrected
to make it a true altitude. Remember also that the IE must be applied, in addition
to these other corrections, in order to make the observed altitude a <img alt="Circle with line through" src="images/circleline.jpg" width="32" height="18" /> altitude.
So there are really five corrections to make instead of four, providing, of course,

<h4><span class="smcap">The Line Of Position</span></h4>
<p>It is practically impossible to fix your position exactly by one observation
of any celestial body. The most you can expect from one sight is to fix your
line of position, i.e., the line somewhere along which you are. If, for
instance, you can get a sight by sextant of the sun, you may be able to work out
from this sight a very accurate calculation of what your latitude is. Say it is
50° N. You are practically certain, then, that you are somewhere in latitude 50°
N, but just where you are you cannot tell until you get another sight for your
longitude. Similarly, you may be able to fix your longitude, but not be able to
fix your latitude until another sight is made. Celestial Navigation, then,
reduces itself to securing lines of position and by manipulating these lines of
position in a way to be described later, so that they intersect. If, for
instance, you know you are on one line running North and South and on another
line running East and West, the only spot where you <em>can</em> be on <em>both</em> lines is where they intersect. This diagram will make that clear:</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Intersection of NS and EW lines" src="images/fig028.jpg" width="400" height="245" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just what a line of position is will now be explained. Wherever the sun is, it
must be perpendicularly above the same spot on the surface of the earth marked in
the accompanying diagram by S<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg
62]</a></span> </p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Line of Position" src="images/fig029.jpg" width="400" height="384" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>and suppose a circle be drawn around this spot as ABCDE. Then if
a man at A takes an altitude, he will get precisely the same one as men at B, C,
D, and E, because they are all at equal distances from the sun, and hence on the
circumference of a circle whose center is S. Conversely, if several observers
situated at different parts of the earth's surface take simultaneous altitudes,
and these altitudes are all the same, then the observers must all be on the
circumference of a circle and <em>only one</em> circle. If they are not on that circle, the altitude
they take will be greater or less than the one in question.</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Observers on circumference of one circle" src="images/fig030.jpg" width="300" height="290" /></p>
<p>Now such a circle on the surface of the earth would be very large - so large that
a small arc of its circumference, say 25 or 30 miles, would be practically a straight
line.</p>
<p>Suppose S to be the point over which the sun is vertical and GF part of the circumference
of a circle drawn around the point. Suppose you were at B and from an altitude of
the sun, taken by sextant, you worked out your position. You would find yourself
on a little arc ABC which, for all purposes in Navigation, is a straight line at
right angles to the true bearing of the sun from the point S. You can readily see
this from the above diagram. Suppose your observer is at H. His line is GHI, which
is again a straight line at right angles to the true bearing of the sun. He is not
certain he is at H. He may be at G or I. He knows, however, he is somewhere on the
line GHI, though where he is on that line he cannot tell exactly. That line GHI
or ABC or DEF is the line of position and such a line is called a Sumner Line, after
Capt. Thomas Sumner, who explained the theory some 45 years ago. Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>Any person taking an altitude of a celestial body must be, for all practical
purposes, on a straight line which is at right angles to the true bearing of the
body observed.</p>
<p>It should be perfectly clear now that if the sun bears due North or South of
the observer, i.e., if the sun is on the observer's meridian, the resulting line
of position <em>must</em> run due East and West. In other words it is a parallel of latitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg
63]</a></span> And that explains why a noon observation is the best of the day for
getting your latitude accurately. Again, if the sun bears due East or West the line
of position must bear due North and South. And that explains why a morning or afternoon
sight - about 8-9 A.M. or 3-4 P.M., if the sun bears either East or West respectively,
is the best time for determining your North and South line, or longitude.</p>
<p>Now suppose you take an observation at 8 A.M. and you are not sure of your D.R.
latitude. Your 8 A.M. position when the sun was nearly due East, will give, you
an almost accurate North and South line and longitude. Suppose that from 8 A.M.
to noon you sailed NE 60 miles. Suppose at noon you get another observation. That
will give you an East and West line, for then the sun bears true North and South.
An East and West line is your correct latitude. Now you have an 8 A.M. observation
which is nearly correct for longitude and a noon position which is correct for latitude.
How can you combine the two so as to get accurately both your latitude and longitude?
Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>Through the 8 A.M. position, draw a line on the chart at right angles to the
sun&#39;s true bearing. Suppose the sun bore true E ½ S. Then your line of position
would run N ½ E. Mark it 1st Position Line.</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Position Lines" src="images/fig031.jpg" width="500" height="308" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now draw a line running due East and West at right angles to the N-S noon bearing
of the sun and mark this line Second Position Line. Advance your First Position
Line the true course and distance sailed from 8 A.M. to noon, and through the extremity
draw a third line exactly parallel to the first line of position. Where a third
line (the First Position Line advanced) intersects the Second Position Line, will
be your position at noon. It cannot be any other if your calculations are correct.
You knew you were somewhere on your 8 A.M. line, you know you are somewhere on your
noon line, and the only spot where you can be on both at once is the point where
they intersect. You don&#39;t necessarily have to wait until noon to work two lines.
You can do it at any time if a sufficient interval of time between sights is allowed.
The whole matter simply resolves itself into getting your two lines of position,
having them intersect and taking the point of intersection as the position of your
ship.</p>
<p>There is one other way to get two lines to intersect and it is one of the best
of all for fixing your position accurately. It is by getting lines of position by
observation of two stars. If, for instance, you can get two stars, one East and
the other West of you, you can take observations of both so closely together as
to be practically simultaneous. Then your Easterly star would give you a line like
AA&#39; and the westerly star the line BB&#39; and you would be at the intersection S.</p>

<h3><a name="WEDNESDAY_LECTURE_IV" id="WEDNESDAY_LECTURE_IV"></a>WEDNESDAY LECTURE</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Latitude By Meridian Altitude</span></h4>
<p>A meridian altitude is an altitude taken when the sun or other celestial body
observed bears true South or North of the observer or directly overhead. In other
words, when the celestial body is on your meridian and you take an altitude of the
body by sextant at that instant, the altitude you get is called a meridian altitude.
In the case of the sun, such a meridian altitude is at apparent noon. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg
65]</a></span> latitude is always secured most accurately at noon by means of your
meridian altitude. The reason for this was explained in yesterday&#39;s lecture. The
general formula for latitude by meridian altitude is (Put in your Note-Book):</p>
<p>Latitude by meridian altitude = Zenith Distance (ZD) ± Declination (Dec).</p>
<p>Zenith distance is the distance in degrees, minutes and seconds from your zenith
to the center of the observed body. For simplicity&#39;s sake, we will consider the
sun only as the observed body. Then the zenith distance is the distance from your
zenith to the center of the sun. Now suppose that you and the sun are both North
of the equator and you are North of the sun. If you can determine exactly how far
North you are of the sun and how far North the sun is of the equator, you will,
by adding these two measurements together, know how far North of the equator you
are, i.e., your latitude. As already explained, the declination of the sun is its
distance in degrees, minutes and seconds from the equator and the exact amount of
declination is, of course, corrected to the proper G.M.T. Your zenith distance is
the distance in the celestial sphere you are from the sun. You know that it is 90°
from your zenith to the horizon. Your zenith distance, therefore, is the difference
between the true meridian altitude of the sun, obtained by your sextant, and 90°.
Hence, having secured the true meridian altitude of the sun, you have only to subtract
it from 90° to find your zenith distance, i.e., how far you are from the sun. This
diagram will make the whole matter clear:</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Find Zenith Distance from Meridian Altitude" src="images/fig033.jpg" width="400" height="380" /> </p>
<p class="center"><strong>A = Zenith, B = Sun, C = Horizon.</strong></p>
<p>The arc ABC measures 90°. That is the distance from your zenith to the horizon.
Now if BC is the true meridian altitude of the sun at noon, 90°-BC or AB is your
zenith distance. If BC measures by sextant 60°, AB measures 90°-60° or 30°. This
30° is your Zenith Distance. Now suppose that from the Nautical Almanac we find
that the G.M.T. corresponding to the time at which we measured the meridian altitude
of the sun shows the sun&#39;s declination to be 10° N. Well, if you are 30° North of
the sun, and the sun is 10° North of the equator, you must be 40° North of the equator
or in latitude 40° N. For that is all latitude is, namely, the distance in degrees,
minutes and seconds you are due North or South of the equator. That is the first
and simplest case.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>Another case is when you are somewhere in North latitude and the sun&#39;s declination
is South. Then the situation would, roughly, look like this:</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Observer in N latitude, Sun's declination is S" src="images/fig034.jpg" width="500" height="201" />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><strong>BC = Altitude of the sun, AB = Zenith Distance and DB
= Sun's Declination.</strong></p>
<p>In this case, your distance North of the equator AD would be your zenith distance
AB minus the sun&#39;s declination DB. This diagram is not strictly correct, for the
observer&#39;s position on the earth 0 appears to be South of the equator instead of
North of the equator. That is because the diagram is on a flat piece of paper instead
of on a globe. So far as illustrating the Zenith Distance minus the Declination,
however, the diagram is correct. The last case is where you are, say, 10° N of the
sun (your zenith Distance is 10°) and the sun is in 20° S declination. In that case
you would have to subtract your zenith distance from the sun&#39;s declination to get
your latitude, for the sun&#39;s latitude (its declination) is greater than yours.</p>
<p>Now from these three cases we deduce the following directions, which put in your
Note-Book:</p>
<p>Begin to measure the altitude of the sun shortly before noon. By bringing its
image down to the horizon, you can detect when its altitude stops increasing and
starts to decrease. At that instant the sun is on your meridian, it is noon at the
ship, and the angle you read from your sextant is the meridian altitude of the sun.
To work out your latitude, name the meridian altitude S if the sun is south of you
and N if north of you.</p>
<p>Correct the observed altitude to a true altitude by Table 46. If the altitude
is S, the Zenith Distance is N or vice versa. (Note to Instructor: If the sun is
South of you, you are North of the sun and vice versa.)</p>
<p>Correct the declination for the proper G.M.T. as shown by chronometer (corrected).
If zenith distance and declination are both North or both South, add them and the
sum will be the latitude, N or S as indicated. If one is N, and the other S, subtract
the less from the greater and the result will be the latitude in, named N or S after
the greater. Example:</p>

<h3><a name="THURSDAY_LECTURE_IV" id="THURSDAY_LECTURE_IV"></a>THURSDAY LECTURE</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Azimuths Of The Sun</span></h4>
<p>This is a peculiar word to spell and pronounce but its definition is really very
simple. Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>The azimuth of a heavenly body is the angle at the zenith of the observer formed
by the observer&#39;s meridian and a line drawn to the center of the body observed.
Azimuths are named from the latitude in and toward the E in the A.M. and from the
latitude in and toward the W in the P.M.</p>
<p>All this definition means is that, no matter where you are in N latitude, for
instance, if you face N, the azimuth of the sun will be the true bearing of the
sun from you. The same holds true for moon, star or planet, but in this lecture
we will say nothing of the star azimuths for, in some other respects, they are found
somewhat differently from the sun azimuths. Put this in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>To find an azimuth of the sun: Note the time of taking the azimuth by chronometer.
Apply chronometer correction, if any, to get the G.M.T. Convert G.M.T. into G.A.T.
by applying the equation of time. Convert G.A.T. into L.A.T. by applying the longitude
in time. The result is L.A.T. or S.H.A. With the correct L.A.T., latitude and declination,
enter the azimuth tables to get the sun&#39;s true bearing, i.e., its azimuth. Example:</p>
<p>March 15th, 1919. CT 10h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32s. D.R. latitude 40° 10&#39; N, longitude 74° W.

<p>We will take up later a further use of azimuths to find the error of your compass.
Right now all you have to keep in mind is what an azimuth is and how you apply the
formulas already given you to get the information necessary to enter the Azimuth
Tables for the sun&#39;s true bearing at any time of the astronomical day when the sun
can be seen. In consulting these tables it must be remembered that if your L.A.T.
or S.H.A. is, astronomically, 20h (A.M.), you must subtract 12 hours in order to
bring the time within the scope of these tables which are arranged from apparent
six o&#39;clock A.M. to noon and from apparent noon to 6 P.M. respectively.</p>
<p>We are taking up sun azimuths today in order to get a thorough understanding
of them before beginning a discussion of the Marc St. Hilaire Method which we will
have tomorrow. You must get clearly in your minds just what a line of position is
and how it is found. Yesterday I tried to explain what a line of position was, i.e.,
a line at right angles to the sun&#39;s or other celestial body&#39;s true bearing
- in other
words, a line at right angles to the sun&#39;s or other celestial body&#39;s azimuth. Today
I tried to show you how to find your azimuth from the azimuth tables for any hour
of the day. Tomorrow we will start to use azimuths in working out sights for lines
of position by the Marc St. Hilaire Method.</p>
<p>Note to Instructor: Spend the rest of the time in finding sun azimuths in the
tables by working out such examples as these:</p>
<p>1. April 29th, 1919. D.R. latitude 40° 40&#39; N, Longitude 74° 55&#39; 14&quot; W. CT 10h&nbsp;&nbsp; 14m&nbsp;&nbsp; 24s.
CC 4m&nbsp;&nbsp; 30s slow. Find TZ.</p>
<p>2. May 15th, 1919. D.R. latitude 19° 20&#39; S, Longitude 40° 15&#39; 44&quot; E. CT 10h&nbsp;&nbsp; 44m&nbsp;&nbsp; 55s
A.M. CC 3m&nbsp;&nbsp; 10s fast. Find TZ.</p>
<p>Note to Instructor:</p>
<p>If possible, give more examples to find TZ and also some examples on latitude
by meridian altitude.</p>

<h3><a name="FRIDAY_LECTURE_IV" id="FRIDAY_LECTURE_IV"></a>FRIDAY LECTURE</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Marc St. Hilaire Method By A Sun Sight</span></h4>
<p>You have learned how to get your latitude by an observation at noon. By the Marc
St. Hilaire Method, which we are to take up today, you will learn how to get a line
of position, at any hour of the day. By having this line of position intersect your
parallel of latitude, you will be able to establish the position of your ship, both
as to its latitude and longitude.</p>
<p>Now you have already learned that in order to get your latitude accurately, you
must wait until the sun is on your meridian, i.e., bears due North or South of you,
and then you apply a certain formula to get your latitude. When the sun is on or
near the prime vertical (i.e., due East or West) you might apply another set of
rules, which you have not yet learned, to get your longitude. By the Marc St. Hilaire
method, the same set of rules apply for getting a line of position at any time of
the day, no matter what the position of the observed body in the heavens may be.
Just one condition is necessary, and this condition is necessary in all calculations
of this character, i.e., an accurate measurement of the observed body&#39;s altitude
is essential.</p>
<p>What we do in working out the Marc St. Hilaire method, is to assume our Dead
Reckoning position to be correct. With this D. R. position as a basis, we compute
an altitude of the body observed. Now this altitude would be correct if our D. R.
position were correct and vice versa. At the same time we measure by sextant the
altitude of the celestial body observed, say, the sun. If the computed altitude
and the actual observed altitude coincide, the D. R. position is correct. If they
do not, the computed altitude must be corrected and the D. R. position corrected
to coincide with the observed altitude. Just how this is done will be explained
in a moment. Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p class="center"><em>Formula for obtaining Line of Position by M. St. H. Method.</em></p>

<p>II. Add together the log haversine of the S.H.A. (Table 45), the log cosine of
the Lat. (Table 44), and the log cosine of the Dec. (Table 44) and call the sum
S. S is a log haversine and must always be less than 10. If greater than 10, subtract
10 or 20 to bring it less than 10.</p>
<p>III. With the log haversine S enter table 45 in the adjacent parallel column,
take out the corresponding Natural Haversine, which mark N<sub>S</sub>.</p>
<p>IV. Find the algebraic difference of the Latitude and Declination, and from Table
45 take out the Natural Haversine of this algebraic difference angle. Mark it N<sub>D±L</sub></p>
<p>V. Add the N<sub>S</sub> to the N<sub>D±L</sub>, and the result will be the Natural
Haversine of the calculated zenith distance. Formula N<sub>ZD</sub> = N<sub>S</sub>
+ N<sub>D±L</sub></p>
<p>VI. Subtract this calculated zenith distance from 90° to get the calculated altitude.</p>
<p>VII. Find the difference between the calculated altitude and the true altitude
and call it the altitude difference.</p>
<p>VIII. In your Azimuth Table, find the azimuth for the proper &quot;t,&quot; L and D.</p>
<p>IX. Lay off the altitude difference along the azimuth either away from or toward
the body observed, according as to whether the true altitude, observed by sextant,
is less or greater than the calculated altitude.</p>

This line will be your Line of Position, and the point thus reached, which may be

nearest to the actual position of the observer which you can obtain by the use of

<h4><span class="smcap">A Short Talk On The Planets And Stars</span></h4>
<h4><span class="smcap">Identification Of Stars</span></h4>
<p class="center"><em>1. The Planets</em></p>
<p>You should acquaint yourself with the names of the planets and their symbols.
These can be found opposite Page 1 in the Nautical Almanac. All the planets differ
greatly in size and in physical condition. Three of them - Mercury, Venus and Mars
- are
somewhat like the earth in size and in general characteristics. So far as we know,
they are solid, cool bodies similar to the earth and like the earth, surrounded
by atmospheres of cool vapors. The outer planets on the other hand, i.e., Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are tremendously large - many times the size of the earth,
and resemble the sun more than the earth in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg
73]</a></span> their physical appearance and condition. They are globes of gases
and vapors so hot as to be practically self luminous. They probably contain a small
solid nucleus, but the greater part of them is nothing but an immense gaseous atmosphere
filled with minute liquid particles and heated to an almost unbelievably high temperature.</p>
<p>Of the actual surface conditions on Venus and Mercury, little is definitely known.
Mercury is a very difficult object to observe on account of its proximity to the
sun. It is never visible at night; it must be examined in the twilight just before
sunrise or just after sunset, or in the full daylight. In either case the glare
of the sun renders the planet indistinct, and the heat of the sun disturbs our atmosphere
so as to make accurate visibility almost impossible. The surface of Mercury is probably
rough and irregular and much like the moon. Like the moon, too, it has practically
no atmosphere. Mercury rotates on its axis once in 88 days. Its day and year are
of the same length. Thus the planet always presents the same face toward the sun
and on that side there is perpetual day while on the other side is night - unbroken
and cold beyond all imagination.</p>
<p>Venus resembles the earth more nearly than any other heavenly body. Its diameter
is within 120 miles of the earth&#39;s diameter. The exasperating fact about Venus,
however, is that it is shrouded in deep banks of clouds and vapors which make it
impossible for us to secure any definite facts about it. The atmosphere about Venus
is so dense that sunlight is reflected from the upper surface of the clouds around
the planet and so reaches our telescopes without having penetrated to the surface
at all. From time to time markings have been discovered that at first seemed real
but whether they are just clouds or tops of mountains has never really been established.</p>
<p>Of all the planets, we know more about Mars than any other. And yet practically
nothing is actually known in regard to conditions on the surface of this planet.
We do know, however, that Mars more nearly resembles a miniature of our earth than
any other celestial body. The diameter of Mars is 4,210 miles - almost exactly half
the earth&#39;s diameter. The surface area of Mars is just about equal to the total
area of dry land on the earth. Like the earth, Mars rotates about an axis inclined
to the plane of its orbit, and the length of a Martian day is very nearly equal
to our own. The latest determinations give the length of a Martian solar day as
24h 39m 35s. Fortunately for us, Mars is surrounded by a very light and transparent
atmosphere through which we are able to discover with our telescopes, many permanent
facts.</p>
<p>The most noticeable of these are the dazzling white &quot;polar caps&quot; first identified
by Sir William Herschel in 1784. During the long winter in the northern hemisphere,
the cap at the North pole steadily increases in size, only to diminish during the
next summer under the hot rays of the sun. These discoveries establish without doubt
the presence of vapors in the Martian atmosphere which precipitate with cold and
evaporate with heat. The polar caps, then, are some form of snow and ice or possible
hoar frost. Outside the polar caps the surface of Mars is rough, uneven and of different
colors. Some of the darker markings appear to be long, straight hollows. They are
the so-called &quot;canals&quot; discovered by Schiaparelli in 1877. The term &quot;canal&quot; is an
unfortunate one. The word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg
74]</a></span> implies the existence of water and the presence of beings of sufficient
intelligence and mechanical ability to construct elaborate works. Flammarion in
France and Lowell in the United States claim the word is correctly used, i.e., that
these markings are really canals and that Mars is actually inhabited. The consensus
of opinion among the most celebrated astronomers is contrary to this view. Most
astronomers agree that these canals may not exist as drawn - that they are to great
extent due to defective vision. There is no conclusive proof of man-made work on
Mars, nor of the existence of conscious life of any kind. It may be there but conclusive
proof of it is still lacking.</p>
<p class="center"><em>2. The Stars</em></p>
<p>The planets are often called wanderers in the sky because of their ever changing
position. Sharply distinguished from them, therefore, are the &quot;fixed&quot; stars. These
appear as mere points of light and always maintain the same relative positions in
the heavens. Thousands of years ago the &quot;Great Dipper&quot; hung in the northern sky
just as it will hang tonight and as it will hang for thousands of years to come.
Yet these bodies are not actually fixed in space. In reality they are all in rapid
motion, some moving one way and some another. It is their tremendous distance from
us that makes this motion inappreciable. The sun seems far away from us, but the
nearest star is 200,000 times as far away from us as is the sun. Expressed in miles,
the figure is so huge as to be incomprehensible. A special unit has, therefore,
been invented - a unit represented by the distance traversed by light in one year.
In one second, light travels over 186,000 miles. In 8-1/3 minutes, light reaches
us from the sun and, in doing so, covers the distance that would take the Vaterland
over four centuries to travel. Yet the nearest star is over four &quot;light years&quot; distant
- it
is so far away that it requires over four years for its light to reach us. When
you look at the stars tonight you see them, not as they are, but as they were, even
centuries ago. Polaris, for instance, is distant some sixty &quot;light years.&quot; Had it
disappeared from the heavens at the time Lee surrendered to Grant, we should still
be seeing it and entirely unaware of its disappearance.</p>
<p>Now each star in the heavens is in reality a sun, i.e., a vast globe of gas and
vapor, intensely hot and in a continuous state of violent agitation, radiating forth
heat and light, every pulsation of which is felt throughout the universe. So closely
indeed do many of the stars resemble the sun, that the light which they emit cannot
be distinguished from sunlight. Some of them are larger and hotter than the sun
- some
smaller and cooler. Yet the sun we see can be regarded as a typical star and from
our knowledge of it we can form a fairly correct idea of the nature and characteristics
of these other stars.</p>
<p>Anyone knows that the stars vary in brightness. Some of this variation is due
partly to actual differences among the stars themselves and partly to varying distances.
If all the stars were alike, then those which were farthest away would be faintest
and we could judge a star&#39;s distance by its brilliancy. This is not the case, however.
Some of the more brilliant stars are far more distant than some of the fainter ones.
There are stars near and remote and an apparently faint star<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg
75]</a></span> may in reality be larger and more brilliant than a star of the first
magnitude. Vega, for instance, is infinitely farther away from us than the sun,
yet its brightness is more than 50 times that of the sun. Polaris, still farther
away, has 100 times the light and heat of the sun. In fact the sun, considered as
a star, is relatively small and feeble.</p>
<p class="center"><em>3. Identification of Stars</em></p>
<p>Only the brighter stars can be used in navigation. So much light is lost in the
double reflection in the mirrors of the sextant, that stars fainter than the third
magnitude can seldom be observed. This reduces the number of stars available for
navigation to within very narrow limits, for there are only 142 stars all told which
are of the third magnitude or brighter. The Nautical Almanac gives a list of some
150 stars which may be used, but as a matter of fact, the list might be reduced
to some 50 or 60 without serious detriment to the practical navigator. About 30
of these are of the second magnitude or greater and hence easily found. It is not
difficult to learn to know 30 or 40 of the brighter stars, so that they can be recognized
at any time. To aid in locating the stars, many different star charts and atlases
have been published, but most of them are so elaborate that they confuse as much
as they help. The simpler the chart, the fewer stars it pretends to locate, the
better for practical purposes. Also, all charts are of necessity printed on a flat
surface and such a surface can never represent in their true values, all parts of
a sphere. A chart, therefore, which covers a large part of the heavens, is bound
to give a distorted idea of distances or directions in some part of the sky and
must be used with caution.</p>
<p>There are a few stars which form striking figures of one kind or another. These
can always be easily located and form a starting point, so to speak, from which
to begin a search for other stars. Of these groups the Great Dipper is the most
prominent in the northern sky and beginning with this the other constellations can
be located one by one.</p>
<p>When the groups or constellations are not known, then any individual star can
be readily found by means of its Right Ascension, and Declination. As you have already
learned, Declination is equivalent to latitude on the earth and Right Ascension
practically equivalent to longitude on the earth, except that whereas longitude
on the earth is measured E. and W. from Greenwich, Right Ascension is measured to
the east all the way around the sky, from the First Point of Aries. With this in
mind, you can easily see that if a star&#39;s R.A. is less than yours, i.e., less than
L.S.T. or the R.A. of your Meridian, the star is not as far eastward in the heavens,
as is your zenith. In other words it is to the west of you. And vice versa, if the
Star&#39;s R.A. is greater than yours, the Star is more to the eastward than you and
hence to the east of you. Moreover, as R.A. is reckoned all around a circle and
in hours, each hour&#39;s difference between the Star&#39;s R.A. and yours is 1/24 of 360°
or 15°. Hence if a star&#39;s R.A. is, for instance, 2 hours greater than yours, the
star will be found to the east of your meridian and approximately 30° from your
meridian, providing the star is in approximately the same vertical east and west
plane as is your zenith.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg
76]</a></span></p>
<p>When the general east or west direction of any star has been determined, its
north or south position can at once be found from its declination. If you are in
Latitude 40° N. your celestial horizon to the South will be 90° from 40° N. or 50°
S. and to the North it will be 90° + 40° N. = 130° or 40° N. (below the N. pole).
The general position of the equator in the sky is always readily found according
to the latitude you are in. If you are in 40° N. latitude, the celestial equator
would intersect the celestial sphere at a point 40° South of you. Knowing this,
the angular distance of a star North or South of the equator (which is its declination)
should be easily found. Remember, however, that the equator in the sky is a curved
line and hence a star in the East or West which looks to be slightly North of you
may actually be South of you.</p>
<p>Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>If the star is west of you its R.A. is less than yours. If east of you, its R.A.
is greater than yours. Star will be found approximately 15° to east or west of you
for each hourly difference between the star&#39;s R.A. and your R.A. (L.S.T.).</p>
<p>Having established the star&#39;s general east and west direction, its north and
south position can be found from its declination.</p>
<p class="center"><em>4. Time of Meridian Passage of a Star</em></p>
<p>It is often invaluable to know first, when a certain star will be on your meridian
or second, what star will be on your meridian at a certain specified time. Here
is the formula for each case, which put in your Note Book:</p>
<p>1. To find when a certain star will cross your meridian, take from the Nautical
Almanac, the R.A. of the Mean Sun for Greenwich Mean Noon of the proper astronomical
day. Apply to it the correction for longitude in time (West +, East -) as per Table
at bottom of page 2, Nautical Almanac, and the result will be the R.A. of the Mean
Sun at local mean noon, i.e., the distance in sidereal time the mean sun is from
the First Point of Aries when it is on your meridian. Subtract this from the star&#39;s
R.A., i.e., the distance in sidereal time the star is from the First Point of Aries
(adding 24 hours to the star&#39;s R.A., if necessary to make the subtraction possible).
The result will be the distance in sidereal time the star is from your meridian
i.e., the time interval from local mean noon expressed in units of sidereal time.
Convert this sidereal time interval into a mean time interval by always subtracting
the reduction for the proper number of hours, minutes and seconds as given in Table
8, Bowditch. The result will be the local mean time of the star&#39;s meridian passage.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>April 22nd, 1919, A.M. at ship. In Lo. 75° E. What is the local mean time of
the Star Etamin&#39;s meridian passage?</p>

<p>Hence, star will cross meridian at 3h&nbsp;&nbsp; 58m&nbsp;&nbsp; 54s A.M. April 22nd.</p>

<p>2. To find at any hour desired what star will cross your meridian, take the R.A.
of the Mean Sun for Greenwich Mean Noon of the proper astronomical day. Apply to
it the correction for longitude in time (West +, East -) as per table at bottom
of page 2, Nautical Almanac, and the result will be the R.A. of the Mean Sun at
local mean noon; i.e., the distance in sidereal time the mean sun is from the First
Point of Aries when it is on your meridian. Suppose you wish to find the star at
10 P.M. Add 10 sidereal hours to the sun&#39;s R.A. just found. The result will be the
R.A. of your meridian at approximately 10 P.M.</p>
<p>Select in the table on p. 94 the R.A. of the star nearest in time to your R.A.
just secured. Subtract the R.A. of the Mean Sun at local mean noon from the star&#39;s
R.A. just found on p. 94 of the N.A. and the result will be the exact distance in
sidereal time the star you have just identified is from your meridian, i.e., the
time interval from local mean noon expressed in units of sidereal time. Convert
this sidereal time interval into a mean time interval by always subtracting for
the proper number of hours, minutes and seconds as per Table 8, Bowditch. You will
then have secured the name of the star desired and the exact local mean time of
the star&#39;s meridian passage.</p>

<p>To find your latitude by taking an altitude of a star when it is on your meridian,
is one of the quickest and easiest of calculations in all Navigation. The formula
is exactly the same as for latitude by meridian altitude of the sun. In using a
star, however, you do not have to consult your Nautical Almanac to get the G.M.T.
and from that the declination. All you have to do is to turn to page 95 of the Nautical
Almanac, on which is given the declination for every month of the year, of any star
you desire. The rest of the computation is, as said before, the same as for latitude
by the sun and follows the formula Lat. = Dec. ± Z.D. (90° - true altitude). As
when working latitude by the sun, you subtract the Z.D. and Dec. when of opposite
name and add them when of the same name. Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>Formula: Lat. = Dec. ± Z.D. (90° - true altitude).</p>

Star:</p>
<p>1. At sea, May 5th, 1919. Meridian altitude Star Capella, 70° 29&#39; S. HE 32 ft.
Required latitude of ship.</p>
<p>2. At sea, August 14th, 1919. Meridian altitude Star Vega, 60° 15&#39; 45&quot; N. HE

<p>Etc.</p>
<p class="center"><em>Latitude by Polaris</em> (<em>Pole or North Star</em>)</p>
<p>You remember we examined the formula in the N.A. for Lat. by the pole star when
we were discussing sidereal time some weeks ago. We will now take up a practical
case of securing your latitude by this method. Before doing so, however, it may
be of benefit to understand how we can get our latitude by the pole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg
80]</a></span> star. In the first place, imagine that the Pole Star is directly
over the N pole of the earth and is fixed. If that were so, and imagine for a minute
that it is so, then it would be exactly 90° from the Pole Star to the celestial
equator. Now, no matter where you stand, it is 90° from your zenith to your true
horizon. Hence if you stood at the equator, your zenith would be in the celestial
equator and your true horizon would exactly cut the Pole Star. Now, supposing you
went 10° N of the equator. Then your northerly horizon would drop by 10° and the
Pole Star would have an altitude of 10°. In other words, when you were in 10° N
latitude, the pole star would measure 10° high by sextant. And so on up to 90°,
where the Pole Star would be directly over you and you would be at the North Pole.
Now all this is based upon the Pole Star being in the celestial sphere exactly over
the North Pole of the earth. It is not, however. Owing to the revolution of the
earth, the star appears to move in an orbit of a maximum of 1° 08&#39;. Just what part
of that 1° 08&#39; is to be applied to the true altitude of the star for any time of
the sidereal day, has been figured out in the table on page 107 of the Nautical
Almanac. What you have to get first is the L.S.T. Find from the table the correction
corresponding to the L.S.T. and apply this correction with the proper sign to the
true altitude of Polaris. The result is the latitude in. Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>To get latitude by pole star, first get L.S.T. This can be secured by using any
one of the three formulas given you in Week III - Thursday&#39;s Lecture on Sidereal Time
and Right Ascension. Then proceed as per formula in N.A.</p>

<h3><a name="SATURDAY_LECTURE_V" id="SATURDAY_LECTURE_V"></a>SATURDAY LECTURE</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Longitude by Chronometer Sight of the Sun (Time Sight)</span></h4>
<p>You have now learned, first, how to get your latitude by a meridian altitude
of the sun or a star and second, how to get your Line of Position and most probable
fix, including both latitude and longitude, by the Marc St. Hilaire Method, using
for your calculations either the sun or a star. We are now going to take up a method
of getting your longitude only. This method requires as much, if not more, calculation
than the Marc St. Hilaire Method. Its results, on the other hand, are far less complete,
for while the Marc St. Hilaire Method will give you a fairly accurate idea of both
your latitude and longitude, this method will, at best, only give you your longitude.
Moreover, you can use it for accurate results only when the sun bears almost due
East or West of you, for that is the best time, as you have already learned, to
get a line of position running due North and South, which is nothing more than a
meridian of longitude. The only reason we explain this method at all is because
it is in common practice among merchantmen and may, therefore, be of assistance
to you, if you go on a merchant ship. Remember, however, that it belongs to Old
Navigation as distinguished from New Navigation, exemplified by the Marc St. Hilaire
Method. It is undoubtedly being used less and less among progressive, up-to-date
navigators, and will continue to be used less as time goes on. The fact remains,
however, that at present many merchantmen practice it, and so it will do you no
harm to become familiar with the method, too.</p>
<p>This method is based on securing your longitude by a time sight or longitude
by chronometer sight, meaning that at the time the sun bears as near due East or
West as possible, you take a sight of it by sextant and at the same instant note
the time by chronometer. With this information you proceed to work out your problem
and secure your longitude according to the following formula. Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>To find your longitude by chronometer (or time) sight.</p>
<p>1. Take sight by sextant only when the sun bears as near as possible due East
or West. At exact time of taking sight, note chronometer time.</p>
<p>2. Get G.M.T. from corrected chronometer time. Apply Equation of Time to get
the corresponding G.A.T.</p>
<p>3. Correct observed altitude to get T.C.A. Also have at hand Lat. by D. R. and
Polar Distance. (Note: Secure P. D. by subtracting Dec. from 90°, if Lat. and Dec.
are of same name. If Lat. and Dec. are of opposite name, secure P. D. by adding
Dec. to 90°.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>4. Add together the T.C.A. the Lat. by D.R. and the P.D. Divide the sum by 2
and call the quotient Half Sum. From the Half Sum subtract the T.C.A. and call the
answer the Difference.</p>
<p>5. Add together the secant of the Latitude, the cosecant of the P.D., the cosine
of the Half Sum and the sine of the Difference (Table 44). The result will be the
log haversine of the S.H.A. or L.A.T. It must always be less than 10. If greater
than 10, subtract 10 or 20 to bring it less than 10.</p>
<p>6. From Table 45, take out the corresponding S.H.A. (L.A.T.), reading from the
top of the page if P.M. at ship, or from bottom of page if A.M. at the ship.</p>
<p>7. Find the difference between L.A.T. and G.A.T. This difference is Lo. in Time
which turns into degrees, minutes and seconds by Table 7. If G.A.T. is greater than
L.A.T. longitude is West; if G.A.T. is less than L.A.T. longitude is East. Example:</p>
<p>August 26th, 1919, A.M. CT 26d 2h 29m 03s A.M. CC 16m 08s slow. <img alt="Circle with line under" src="images/circleover.jpg" width="16" height="18" class="style10" /> 44° 57&#39; 00&quot;.

<p>I wish to caution you about confusing this method with the one Bowditch uses,
and still another which Henderson uses in his book &quot;Elements of Navigation.&quot; It
is not exactly like either one. It requires one operation less than either, however,
and it also requires the use of fewer parts of the various tables involved. For
that reason it is given you.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Longitude by Chronometer Sight of a Star</span></h4>
<p>In getting your longitude by a time sight of a star, you proceed somewhat differently
from the method used when observing the sun. What you wish to get first is G.S.T.,
i.e., the distance in time Greenwich is from the First Point of Aries. If you can
then get the distance the ship is from the First Point of Aries, the difference
between the two will be the longitude in, marked East or West according as to which
is greater. By looking at the diagram furnished you when we were talking of Sidereal
Time, all this becomes perfectly clear. The full rule for finding longitude by a
star is as follows, which put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>Correct your CT to get your G.M.T. From the G.M.T. get the G.S.T. From the observed
altitude of the star, obtain the star&#39;s H.A. at the ship in the same way L.A.T.
is secured in case of the sun. To or from the R.A. of the star add, if West of your
meridian, subtract if East of your meridian, the star&#39;s H.A. at the ship, just obtained.
The result is the R.A. of the ship&#39;s meridian or L.S.T.</p>
<p>Find the difference between G.S.T. and L.S.T. and the result is the longitude,
marked East or West according as to whether G.S.T. is less or greater than L.S.T.
Note: Always take the star&#39;s H.A. from the top of the page of Table 45.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Latitude by ex-meridian Altitude of the Sun</span></h4>
<p>You have learned that when you calculate your latitude from a meridian
altitude of the sun, one of the necessary requisites is to have the sun exactly
on your meridian. In fact, that is just another way of expressing meridian
altitude, i.e., an altitude taken when the sun is on your meridian. Now suppose
that 10 or 15 minutes <em>before</em>
noon you fear that the sun will be clouded over at noon so that a meridian altitude
cannot be secured. There is a way to calculate your latitude, even though the altitude
you secure is taken by sextant some minutes before or after noon. This is called
latitude by an ex-meridian altitude. It must be kept in mind that this method can
be used accurately only within 26 minutes of noon, either before or after, and only
then when you know your longitude accurately. Put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>1. Get your L.A.T. (S.H.A.).</p>
<p>2. Subtract it from 24h 00m 00s, or vice versa, according as to whether L.A.T.
is just before or just after local apparent noon. Call the result &quot;Time Interval
from Meridian Passage.&quot;</p>
<p>3. With your D.R. latitude, declination and Time Interval from Meridian Passage,
enter Table 26 to get the proper amount of Variation of Altitude in one minute from
meridian passage.</p>
<p>4. With the Time Interval from Meridian Passage and the Variation, enter Table
27 to get the total amount of Variation of Altitude.</p>
<p>5. Add this total amount of Variation to the true observed altitude taken before
or after noon, and the result is the corrected altitude.</p>
<p>6. Then proceed to get your latitude according to the rules already given you
for latitude by meridian altitude.</p>

<h3><a name="SATURDAY_LECTURE_VI" id="SATURDAY_LECTURE_VI"></a>SATURDAY LECTURE</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Finding the Watch Time of Local Apparent Noon</span></h4>
<p>Noon at the ship is the pivotal point of the day&#39;s work at sea. It is then that
the navigator must report to the commanding officer the latitude and longitude by
dead reckoning, the latitude and longitude by observation, the course and distance
made good, the deviation of the compass and the course and distance to destination.
Apparent noon, then, is a most important time to calculate accurately, and to do
so when the ship is under way, is not so easy at it first appears.</p>
<p>If the ship is stationary, and you know the longitude you are in, the problem
is simple. Then it is merely a question of starting with L.A.T. of 00h-00m-00s,
adding or subtracting the longitude, according as to whether it is West or East,
to get G.A.T.; applying the equation of time with sign reversed to get G.M.T.; applying
the C. Cor. with sign reversed to get the C.T.; and applying the C-W to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg
90]</a></span> get the WT. If, for instance, this WT happens to be 11h-42m-31s,
when the watch reads that number of hours, minutes and seconds, the sun will be
on the meridian and it will be apparent noon.</p>
<p>When the ship is moving, the problem is more difficult. At first thought you
might imagine that all you would have to do would be to take the difference between
the L.A.T. of the morning sight and 24 hours, calculate the distance the ship would
run in this time and from that determine the longitude you would be in at noon.
Then proceed as in the case of the ship being stationary. But such a calculation
does not take into consideration the easting or westing of the ship itself. Suppose
that at the morning sight the L.A.T. is found to be 20h-10m-30s. If the ship does
not move, it will be 3h-49m-30s to noon. But suppose the ship is moving eastward.
Then, in addition to the speed at which the sun is approaching the ship, there must
be added the speed at which the ship is moving toward the sun - i.e. the change in
longitude per hour which the ship is making, expressed in minutes and seconds of
time. Likewise, if the ship is moving westward, an allowance must be made for the westing of the ship. And this change of longitude in minutes and seconds of time
must be subtracted from the speed of the sun&#39;s approach since the ship, in going
west, is traveling away from the sun.</p>
<p>There are various ways to calculate this allowance for the ship&#39;s speed, among
the best of which is given in Bowditch, Art. 403, p. 179. Another, and even easier
way, is the following, which was explained to the writer by Lieutenant Commander
R.P. Strough, formerly head of the Seamanship Department of this School:- </p>
<p>1. Take the morning sight for longitude when the sun is on or as near as possible
to the prime vertical.</p>
<p>2. Subtract the L.A.T. of the morning sight from 24 hours. This will give the
total time from the morning sight to noon if the ship were stationary.</p>
<p>3. From the course to noon and speed of the ship, figure the change in longitude
per hour in terms of seconds of time. For instance, suppose a ship were steaming
a course of 275° at the rate of 11 knots per hour in approximately 38° North latitude.
The change of longitude per hour for this speed would be 14&#39; of arc or 56s of time.</p>
<p>4. Now the sun travels at the rate of 60 minutes or 3600 seconds per hour. To
this hourly speed of the sun must be added or subtracted the hourly speed of the
ship according as to whether the ship is going in an easterly or westerly direction.
If, as mentioned above, the ship is steaming a course of 275° (W ½ N) and hence
changing its longitude at the rate of 56s per hour, then the net rate of approach
of the sun per hour would be 3600s - 56s, or 3544s per hour.</p>
<p>5. Divide the total time to noon from the L.A.T. of the morning sight (expressed
in seconds of time) by the net rate of approach of the sun per hour. The result
will be the corrected time to noon - i.e. the time at which the sun will be on the
ship&#39;s meridian when the ship is changing its longitude to the westward at the rate
of 56s per hour.</p>
<p>6. One more step is necessary. To the watch time of the morning sight, add the
corrected time to noon. The result will be the watch time of Local Apparent Noon.
Thirty minutes before will be the watch time of 11:30 A.M. and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg
91]</a></span> at 11:30 A.M. all deck clocks should be set to the local apparent
time of the place the ship will be at local apparent noon.</p>
<p>The following example illustrates the explanation just given and should be
put in your Note Book:- </p>
<p>Example:- At sea, August 7th, 1919. About 7:30 A.M. by ship&#39;s time, position by
observation just found to be Latitude 30° 05&#39; N, Longitude 58° 08&#39; W. WT of morning
sight 6h-53m-13s A.M. C-W 4h-37m-21s. CC + 3m-38s. Course 275°. Speed 11 knots.
TZ N 90° E. What will be the Watch Time of Local Apparent Noon?</p>

<p>When, therefore, the watch reads 10h&nbsp;&nbsp; 51m&nbsp;&nbsp; 25s, the deck clocks should be set to
11.30 A.M. and thirty minutes later it will be apparent noon at the ship.</p>
<p>In all these calculations it is taken for granted that the speed of the ship
and hence the change in longitude can be gauged accurately. A check on this can
be made by comparing the longitude of the A.M. sight with the D.R. longitude of
the same time. Any appreciable difference between the two can be ascribed to current.
Now, if a proportionate amount of current is allowed for in reckoning the speed
of the ship from the time of the A.M. sight to noon, then a proper correction can
be made in the net rate of approach of the sun and the corrected time to noon will
be very close to the exact time of noon. Of course there will be an error in this
calculation but it will be small and the result gained will be accurate enough for
ordinary work.</p>
<p>So much for finding the watch time of Local Apparent Noon. Careful navigators
carry the process further and get the watch times of 15, 10 and 5 minutes before
noon, so that by the use of constants for each one of these times, an accurate check
on the noon latitude can be quickly and easily secured. We have not time in this
course to explain how these constants are worked out but it is well worth knowing.
The information regarding it is in Bowditch Art. 325, p. 128, and Art. 405, p. 181.</p>
<p>A word about the watch used by the navigator should be included here. This watch
should be a good one and receive as much care, in its way, as the chronometer. It
should be wound at the same time every day, carefully handled and, in other respects,
treated like the fine time-piece that it is.</p>
<p>While authorities differ on this point, the best practice seems to be not to
change the navigator&#39;s watch to correspond with the apparent time of each day&#39;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg
93]</a></span> noon position. The reason for this is two-fold. First, because constant
moving of the hands will have an injurious effect on the works of the watch, and
second, because, by not changing the watch, the C-W remains approximately the same,
and thus a good check can be kept on both the watch and the chronometer as well
as on the navigator&#39;s figures in reckoning the times of his various sights.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Compass Error by an Azimuth</span></h4>
<p>The easiest and most accurate way to find the error of your compass is, first,
to find the bearing of the sun by your pelorus. If you set your pelorus, so that
it will exactly coincide with the course you are steaming as shown by the compass
in your chart house and then get a bearing of the sun by noting where the shadow
from the pelorus vane cuts the circumference, this bearing will be the bearing of
the sun by compass. At the same time, get your true bearing of the sun from the
Azimuth Tables. The difference between the two will be the compass error, marked
East or West according to the following rule which put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>1. Express your Compass Bearing and your True Bearing by NEW compass reading.</p>
<p>2. If TZ is to the right of CZ, C.E. is East. Formula: True - Right - East.</p>
<p>3. If TZ is to the left of CZ, C.E. is West. Formula: True - Left - West.</p>
<p>You must now remember that what you have is a Compass Error, consisting of both
Variation and Deviation. To find the Deviation, the Variation and C.E. being given,
is merely to apply the rules already given you under Dead Reckoning. For instance,
if you had a C.E. of 10° W and a Variation of 4° E, the Deviation would be 14° W.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Correcting Longitude by a Factor</span></h4>
<p>We are now almost ready to begin the discussion of a day&#39;s work at sea. The only
method we have not taken up is the one which is the subject of today&#39;s lecture.
It is a method to correct your longitude to correspond with the difference between
your latitude by Dead Reckoning and your latitude by observation.</p>
<p>Suppose you take a sight in the morning for longitude. The only latitude you
can use is a D. R. latitude, advanced from your last known position. Now suppose
you run until noon and at that time take a sight for latitude. In comparing your
D. R. latitude, advanced the true course and distance steamed to noon, and your
latitude by observation taken at noon, suppose there is a difference of several
minutes. The question is&#8212;How can we correct our longitude to correspond with this
error discovered in the latitude? This is the method which put in your Note-Book:</p>
<p>Find the difference between the latitude by D. R. and the corresponding latitude
by observation (in most cases secured from a sight at noon or from the Star Polaris).
Call this the Error in Latitude. With the D. R. Latitude of the preceding sight
and the azimuth or bearing of the preceding sight (always expressed as a bearing
of less than 90°, old compass reading) enter Table 47 for the correct Longitude
Factor. Multiply this Factor by the Error in Latitude. The result is the correction
to apply to the Longitude. It is applied East or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg
96]</a></span> West according as to whether the Latitude by Observation is to the
East or West of the D. R. Latitude on the Line of Position (the line at right angles
to the Azimuth) of the preceding sight.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Position about 7:30 A.M. Latitude by D. R. 25° 40&#39; S, Longitude (just secured
by observation) 104° 05&#39; 38&quot; E. L.A.T. 7h 32m 30s A.M., Declination 4° 59&#39; N. Thence
ship ran to noon 109°, true course, 46 miles, when the latitude by meridian altitude
of the sun was found to be 25° 52&#39; S. Required corrected longitude at noon.</p>

<h3><a name="THURSDAY_LECTURE_VII" id="THURSDAY_LECTURE_VII"></a>THURSDAY LECTURE</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Navigator&#39;s Routine&#8212;a Day&#39;s Work at Sea</span></h4>
<p>You are now familiar with the principal kinds of sights and the methods used
in working them as explained in the foregoing pages. This information, however,
relates only to each individual kind of sight. Today I will explain briefly how
those sights are made use of in your daily work at sea. Such an explanation necessarily
cannot include the navigator&#39;s work under all conditions and on all classes of ships.
It merely gives a brief outline of and a few suggestions relating to navigating
conditions on board a medium-sized transport, in time of war. I say &quot;in time of
war&quot; because navigating then is different, to some extent, from the ordinary routine
in time of peace.</p>
<p>Suppose you are ordered to a ship as navigator. What are your duties (a) before
leaving port, (b) while at sea, and (c) on entering pilot waters?</p>
<p class="center"><em>(a) Before Leaving Port</em></p>
<p>Ascertain the height of the eye of the bridge and any other place on the ship
where you would be likely to take sights.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg
98]</a></span></p>
<p>Have posted in the chart room and on the bridge the deviation of the compass
on each 15° heading, so that it can be easily referred to.</p>
<p>Keep in each chronometer case or in a book nearby the error and daily rate of
all chronometers on board.</p>
<p>Test each sextant for index error and record the result where you can refer to
it easily.</p>
<p>See that all charts of the harbor out of which you are to steam are corrected
to date and are familiar to you, both as to sailing directions and buoys, and also
as to lights and other aids to navigation.</p>
<p>Examine, in detail, the steering engine and steering apparatus. In case of its
disarrangement your intimate knowledge of it may be most valuable.</p>
<p>See that the patent log and sounding machine are in good order. See that the
lead lines are well soaked in water, stretched, and properly marked.</p>
<p>See that the lighting system in the chart room and the navigator&#39;s room is such
that when any door is not tightly closed the lights in the room are extinguished.
Likewise, when the doors are closed, see that the lights will light and without
repeated slamming of the doors.</p>
<p>If possible, provide yourself with a flashlight set back in a metal tube so that
the rays of the light are not diffused but can be focussed only on one spot at a
time.</p>
<p>See that your charts are arranged neatly in the drawers provided for them in
the chart room. If, as is usual, the charts must be folded to get them in the drawers,
mark them legibly on the outside and in the same place on each chart. Put in the
top drawers those charts you know you will use most frequently. This will save endless
time and confusion.</p>
<p>Be sure you have a full complement of necessary instruments, including sextants,
a stadimeter, binoculars, watches, stop watch, dividers, parallel rulers, pencils,
work books; also all necessary books, such as smooth and deck log books, several
volumes of Bowditch, Nautical Almanacs, Azimuth Tables, Pilot books, Light and Buoy
lists, Star Identification Tables, etc. You will be repaid a thousand times for
whatever effort you expend to have your navigational equipment complete to the smallest
detail. The shortage, for instance, of a pair of dividers would be an unending annoyance
to you. This is also true of almost any other item mentioned above. Prepare yourself,
then, while you are in port and have plenty of opportunity to secure the equipment
you desire.</p>
<p class="center"><em>(b) While at Sea</em></p>
<p>The least amount of work required of a navigator in time of peace would include
(1) a morning sight for longitude, (2) a noon sight for latitude, (3) an afternoon
sight for longitude, (4) an A.M. azimuth to check the deviation of the compass,
and (5) the dead reckoning for the day&#39;s run from noon to noon.</p>
<p>Navigating in war time requires more work than this. If possible, the ship&#39;s
position must be known accurately at any time of day or night for, in case of an
emergency, the lives of all on board may be imperilled by inaccurate knowledge of
your whereabouts. This means that more sights must be taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg
99]</a></span> and more celestial bodies observed. While every navigator has his
own idea as to the proper amount of work to do in a day, it would seem as though
the following would cover the minimum amount of work necessary under present conditions:</p>
<p>1. An A.M. sight of the sun for longitude.</p>
<p>2. An azimuth of the sun for checking the deviation of the compass, taken right
after the A.M. sun sight.</p>
<p>3. The watch time of Local Apparent Noon.</p>
<p>4. Ex-meridian and meridian altitudes of the sun for latitude.</p>
<p>5. A P.M. sight of the sun for longitude.</p>
<p>6. An evening twilight sight of three or four stars, preferably one in each quadrant.
If these altitudes are taken correctly your position can be found to the dot.</p>
<p>7. A morning twilight sight for a fix or, at least, for latitude by Polaris.</p>
<p>8. The dead reckoning from noon to noon.</p>
<p>9. Distance run during the last 24 hours, from noon to noon</p>
<p>10. Distance to destination.</p>
<p>11. Set and drift of the current.</p>
<p class="center"><em>1. The A.M. Sun Sight</em></p>
<p>In order to make this a valuable sight for longitude it should be taken when
the sun is on or as near as possible to the prime vertical. As the sun, in North
latitudes, passes the prime vertical before sunrise in the winter, the following
remarks do not hold for that season. In winter the only rule to follow is to observe
the sun as soon as it is 10° or more above the horizon. In summer find out from
the Azimuth Tables the local apparent time when the sun will bear 90°. Estimate,
as closely as possible, the longitude you will be in the next morning when the local
apparent time is as just found in the Azimuth Tables. This can be done by calculating
the dead reckoning from the previous sight, or, what is even simpler, laying the
distance off on the plotting chart. With this information find the W.T. corresponding
to the L.A.T. mentioned above by some such formula as this: L.A.T. ± Lo. = G.A.T.
± Eq. T. (sign reversed) = G.M.T. ± C.C.(sign reversed) = C.T. - (C-W) = W.T. This
will not be absolutely accurate, for the longitude you are in is only approximate,
but it will be close enough for good results. This resulting W.T. will be the time
to take the A.M. sight. About fifteen minutes before that time compare your watch
with your chronometer to get the C-W. Also bring up the C.C. to date and make a
note of it so that as much as possible of this detail work is accomplished before
the sight is taken. Next, take your sextant and test it for index error. This should
be done regularly before each series of sights as it is impossible to tell what
may have happened when the sextant is lying idle, except by the above test. Now,
with your sextant, watch and notebook, go to the place from which you have decided
to take your observations and, at the proper watch time, start taking your altitudes.
It is always advisable to take a number of sights, closely following each other,
so that an error in one may be corrected somewhat by the others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg
100]</a></span> Take at least three sights in close succession. At the same time
have the log read and enter it in your notebook. An equally good method in fair
weather is to secure the distance run from the revolutions of the propeller.</p>
<p>Having taken your sights, go to the standard compass and get a bearing of the
sun, at the same time noting in your book the W.T. of the bearing and the compass
heading of the ship. You are now ready to go below into the chart room and work
out your position. What method shall you use? That depends upon your preference.
You have missed the point of the previous lectures, however, if you forget that
the New Navigation is based upon the Marc St. Hilaire Method, and this is undoubtedly
the method your captain will prefer you to use if he is an Annapolis graduate. In
this connection let me remind you again of the one fact, the oversight of which
discourages so many beginners with the Marc St. Hilaire Method. The most probable
fix, which you get by one sight only, is not actually a fix at all. Nor does any
other method give you an accurate fix under like conditions. What the most probable
fix is, and all it claims to be, is a point through which the required Sumner line
is to be drawn. If your D.R. position happens to be only one mile away from the
most probable fix, that is no assurance that the most probable fix is near the actual
position of the ship. You may be 25 miles away from it. But the important information
gained is that, though you may be 25 miles away, you know on what line you are,
and when this line is later crossed with another line of position that fix will
be accurate. &quot;Two sights make a fix&quot; is the whole matter in a nutshell.</p>
<p class="center"><em>2. The Compass Error</em></p>
<p>Having secured your morning sight, the next duty is to get the compass error.
From your morning sight computation you know the watch time corresponding to the
L.A.T. of the same sight. Find the difference between the two and apply this difference
to the watch time of the compass azimuth. That will give you the L.A.T. with which
to enter the Azimuth Tables to get the true bearing corresponding to the compass
bearing recently observed. Apply the variation from the chart to get the magnetic
bearing. The difference between this magnetic bearing and the compass bearing will
be the required deviation, which you should compare with your Deviation Table. If
there is a marked difference, and you are sure of your figures, use the new deviation
in computing courses on this heading of the ship.</p>
<p class="center"><em>3. The Watch Time of Local Apparent Noon</em></p>
<p>You are now ready to figure the watch time of local apparent noon. Unless you
have a decided preference to the contrary, do this by the method explained in
the Saturday Lecture, Week VI. Do not forget that in subtracting the L.A.T. of
the morning sight from 24 hours to get the total time to noon, in case the ship
were stationary, you do <em>not</em> use the L.A.T. of the D.R. position, but the L.A.T. found by subtracting
from G.A.T. the longitude of the most probable fix. This will give you the L.A.T.,
based on the longitude of the most probable fix, which will be slightly different
from the L.A.T. based on the D.R. longitude. When you have secured the watch time
of local apparent noon, subtract 30 minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg
101]</a></span> from it and notify the quartermaster that at that time by your watch
the deck clocks are to be set to 11.30 A.M. If this change of time is very great
(providing you are on an almost easterly or westerly course), it is wise to have
the clocks set back in the night watches to allow for most of the time you figure
you will lose. This will not work such a hardship or such an advantage to the officers
and men who have the forenoon watch and will also be easier for the cooks. The clocks
can then be slightly but accurately changed at 11.30 A.M., as mentioned above.</p>
<p class="center"><em>4. Ex-Meridian and Meridian Altitudes</em></p>
<p>You know the principles and methods governing sights of this character. To know
your latitude exactly at noon is usually required when you are steaming in convoy,
for at that time your position signals are hoisted, and it is a matter of pride
with the navigator not only to have his position exact but promptly. If your A.M.
sight was taken when the sun was on or near the prime vertical, a change in latitude
at noon will make no change in longitude. Hence you can figure your longitude at
noon just as soon as you have secured the corrected time from the A.M. sight to
noon (which you have done right after working the A.M. sight). You will have your
longitude, then, before you go on the bridge to observe for ex-meridian and meridian
altitudes.</p>
<p>Sharply at noon you take your meridian altitude and tell a messenger to notify
the captain that it is noon at the ship. The captain then orders eight bells struck,
and you are ready to hand in your noon report, consisting of latitude and longitude
by observation, latitude and longitude by dead reckoning, deviation of the compass
on the ship&#39;s head at 8 A.M., distance made good since the preceding noon, distance
to destination, set and drift of current (Note:&#8212;When steaming in convoy this is
unnecessary and usually omitted), and any other pertinent remarks. If the sun was
not taken on or near the prime vertical at the time of the A.M. sight, take out
your longitude factor for the coming noon position and calculate your D.R. latitude
at noon. By correcting the longitude of the A.M. sight, run to noon, with the difference
of longitude, readily found at noon with the longitude factor and the error in latitude,
you will have the correct noon longitude to hand in, with only a moment&#39;s delay.
It will be very hard, however, to get all this information in on time without the
use of latitude constants. There is no room for a discussion of these constants
here, but they are easy to work and you should learn how to use them. The information
is in Bowditch Art. 325, p. 128, and Art. 405, p. 181.</p>
<p class="center"><em>5. The P.M. Sun Sight</em></p>
<p>This is another longitude sight and so any previous remarks about sights of this
character are applicable here. If the day is fine you need not work out this sight
until after evening twilight, for a fix then by stars will give both latitude and
longitude, whereas your afternoon sun sight will only give you a longitude. This
P.M. sun sight is a good check sight, to be used or not, according as to whether
other earlier or later sights have been obtained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg
102]</a></span></p>
<p class="center"><em>6. The Evening Twilight Sight</em></p>
<p>The beauty of using stars is that by almost simultaneous altitudes of different
ones you can ascertain your position, both as to latitude and longitude. In the
North Atlantic during the summer months Vega, Deneb or Altair in the East, Antares
or Deneb Kaitos in the South, Arcturus in the West, and Polaris, Mizar, or Kochab
in the North form an ideal combination which includes every quadrant of the compass.
In the winter months, Capella, Castor or Pollux in the East, Sirius or any star
in Orion&#39;s belt in the South, Deneb in the West, and Polaris in the North are equally
as good.</p>
<p class="center"><em>7. The Morning Twilight Sight</em></p>
<p>In clear weather this should be primarily a sight for latitude, since the A.M.
sun sight for longitude will follow it. A latitude by Polaris, and at the same time
some star in one of the southern quadrants, as a check, will give admirable results.</p>
<p class="center"><em>8. The Dead Reckoning from Noon to Noon</em></p>
<p>If there is no change of course in the late forenoon, as is usually the case,
the dead reckoning for the day&#39;s run can be figured any time before noon so that
it will be all ready to hand in to the captain with the other noon data. It is much
easier to lay this off on the chart than to go to the trouble of calculating it
by Table 2, Bowditch. On the other hand, such a calculation checks the chart work
and should be worked out if you wish to make &quot;assurance doubly sure.&quot;</p>
<p class="center"><em>9. Distance Run During the Last 24 Hours</em></p>
<p>Here, again, an answer by chart and an answer by figures is a good thing to secure.
As you become accustomed to your work you will find the answer by chart infinitely
easier and quicker to get. It is just as accurate, too, if you lay the distances
off carefully with the dividers and parallel rulers.</p>
<p class="center"><em>10. Distance to Destination</em></p>
<p>The same remarks as are made under (9) hold true here.</p>
<p class="center"><em>11. Set and Drift of Current</em></p>
<p>Find the difference between your D.R. position and your position by observation
at noon, i.e., the course and distance from your D.R. position to your position
by observation. The course is the set of the current, the distance the amount of
drift, all of which is easily calculated by Table 2, Bowditch. This difference between
the two positions is seldom due to current. It is due to all errors of steering
and the like. But these are all ascribed to current, for the sake of convenience.
This calculation of the current is seldom used now, particularly when steaming in
convoy.</p>
<p>It is obvious that a schedule, such as outlined above, cannot be adhered to in
all kinds of weather or under all conditions. It is merely an outline of what might
properly be included in a 24 hour day, the weather conditions of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg
103]</a></span> will lend themselves at any time to taking the observations mentioned.
The weather of each succeeding day may force you to adopt a different routine. Nevertheless,
the closer you can keep to the above schedule the more exact will your various positions
be.</p>
<p class="center"><em>(c) On Entering Pilot Waters</em></p>
<p>See that all charts of the locality you intend to enter are corrected to date.</p>
<p>Study these charts carefully, making notes, in detail, of the aids to navigation
that you intend to pick up.</p>
<p>In noting lights give their distinctive appearance, range of visibility, approximate
time of sighting them, and any other information that you think you may need. If
you have this information with you when on the bridge it will save much time and
trouble that you would otherwise have to spend, at possibly a critical time, in
the chart room.</p>
<p>See that log lines, sounding machine, etc., are in order for instant use.</p>
<p>Remember that in entering pilot waters the safest landmarks are permanent ones.
Buoys, cans, etc., may drag from their positions or be lost altogether. This can
also happen to lightships.</p>
<p>Become familiar with soundings, rise and fall of the tides, and the like, in
the neighborhood in which you intend to anchor. If possible choose an anchorage
that will enable you to get bearings from two or three fixed points on shore. As
soon as possible after anchoring secure your bearings by pelorus and have them checked
up by the quartermaster at regular intervals. This will determine how much, if any,
dragging has taken place.</p>
<p>Lastly, always remember that no amount of advice can make up for your own carelessness.
Hold yourself ready for any emergency, keep cool, keep patient and keep pleasant.
Common sense is the best antidote in the world for strange situations. If you have
that, and the knowledge you should have secured from these lectures, you cannot
go far wrong.</p>
<p>While the day&#39;s work which follows does not include every sight in regular sequence
as given in the above discussion, it will give a fair idea of the navigator&#39;s work
during a day&#39;s run. Put it in your notebook. (Note to Instructor:&#8212;Spend the rest
of the period in explaining carefully each step of this example.)</p>

<h3><a name="ADDITIONAL_LECTURE" id="ADDITIONAL_LECTURE"></a>ADDITIONAL LECTURE</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Compass Adjustment</span></h4>
<p>The aim of this lecture is to give you a very few facts about magnetism in general
and compass adjustment in particular. The reason for including the lecture in this
book is because of repeated requests on the part of graduates who have been consulted
about the adjustment of the compass on their ships and who have realized that their
advice might have been more helpful if they had learned more about the matter The earth is a huge magnet. It is the effect of the magnetism in the earth upon
the compass needle which causes the compass error and makes it necessary to correct
it. How can it be corrected? To know that we must first know the fundamental law
of magnetism, namely, that opposite poles of two magnets attract each other and
similar poles repel each other. From which it follows that if we decide to color
red, for instance, that end of a magnetic needle which points to North, the magnetism
of that part of the earth must be considered blue, i.e., of opposite magnetism to
the north-seeking end of the red magnetic needle.</p>
<p>Now, there are various kinds of magnetism which affect a ship&#39;s compass. One
is from the earth, another from the iron in the ship, etc. To discuss them and,
the theoretical cause of them in detail is beyond the scope of this lecture. To
correct them, four sets of magnets are necessary, two of which are usually found
in the binnacle of the compass itself. One is a fore and aft magnet or set of magnets,
the other an athwartship magnet or set of magnets. The third set consists of the
two globes of cast iron placed on either side of the compass bowl (called Quadrantal
Correctors). The fourth magnet, or set of magnets, is to correct the compass in
case of severe heeling by the ship.</p>
<p>If you are ordered to adjust the compass the first thing to do is to choose a
fine day with smooth water. Take your ship to a certain spot, the exact location<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg
116]</a></span> of which you have found from the chart, and where you are certain
you will have plenty of sea-way in which to swing. Set your watch to local apparent
time (which you have calculated before coming out). Take from the Azimuth Tables
the sun&#39;s true bearing for every four minutes of the time during which you will
be occupied adjusting, and convert it into the magnetic bearing by applying the
variation at the place selected (secured from the chart). Write down in a small
book these times and corresponding magnetic bearings.</p>
<p>Now go to your compass and see that its lubber line is exactly fore and aft and
in the keel line of the ship. Have another officer who is thoroughly familiar with
the pelorus stand by it as the ship is swung. All being ready, secure the lubber&#39;s
point of the pelorus at North and clamp the sight vane to the sun&#39;s magnetic bearing
at the time you have figured to take the first heading. Starboard or port your helm
until at the time calculated the reflection of the sight vane on the pelorus dial
cuts on the proper magnetic bearing. The vessel&#39;s head will then be pointing to
magnetic North. If, now, the compass were correct it would agree with the pelorus
in showing the ship&#39;s head to be North. If it does not do so, there is Deviation
in the compass and its amount is the amount of Deviation on that particular course.
Suppose the Deviation were to starboard, i.e., Easterly, and were due to magnetism
in the ship&#39;s starboard side. Then, if the magnetism in the North end of the needle
be considered red, the magnetism in the starboard side of the vessel, in order to
attract the red end of the needle, would be considered blue and the ship&#39;s magnetism,
with the compass needle included, would look like this:</p>
<p>To counteract this blue attractive force on the starboard side, screw up the
athwartship magnet in the binnacle toward the compass dial. Its magnetism, if it
were laid on the deck, would look like this:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg
117]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Compass Correction" src="images/fig041.jpg" width="406" height="500" />
</p>
<p>In other words, as this magnet is moved nearer the compass needle, by the law
of magnetism just given, the red end of the magnet repels the red end of the compass
needle from the starboard side and the blue end of the magnet attracts the red end
of the compass needle toward the port side. When the compass needle points to North,
as shown by the correct pelorus bearing, the Deviation on this heading (i.e., North)
is corrected.</p>

<p class="center">
<img alt="Compass Correction" src="images/fig042.jpg" width="396" height="500" />
</p>
<p>Now turn the lubber line of the pelorus to East. Steady the ship on this heading
until the shadow from the pelorus vane at the proper L.A.T. cuts the circumference
of the pelorus dial at the proper magnetic bearing. The ship&#39;s compass should then
show the ship&#39;s head pointing to East. Suppose that it does not (as will usually
be the case) but points to the right of East. Then the ship&#39;s magnetism and compass
would look like this:</p>

<p>To bring the compass needle back to North it would be necessary to move up nearer
the compass dial the fore-and-aft magnet (shown below), whose magnetism would act
on the compass needle on this heading of the ship exactly as the athwartship magnet
acted on the compass needle when the ship was headed North:</p>
<p class="center">
<img alt="Compass Correction" src="images/fig043.jpg" width="500" height="405" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the ship&#39;s compass has been corrected for the North and East headings respectively.
The next correction is for the heading half way between, i.e., North-east. If there
is any Deviation on this heading, adjust the cast iron cylinders (called Quadrantal
Correctors), which are on each side of the compass bowl, by moving them toward or
away from the compass until the ship&#39;s head by compass is North-east at the proper
time and bearing by pelorus.</p>
<p>The ship&#39;s compass has now been corrected for one whole quadrant, namely, from
North to East, and this will suffice for all four quadrants since the relationships
of the magnets themselves and the magnetism of the compass needle is the same for
any of the other three quadrants as for the first. Compass adjustment, however,
can never be absolutely accurate. For that reason, it is wise to steam the ship
completely around, steadying on every fifteen degrees by pelorus to determine and
keep a record of remaining errors.</p>

<p class="center">
<img alt="Compass Correction" src="images/fig044.jpg" width="500" height="414" />
</p>
<p>There is one more correction to make, i.e., for the heeling error. This correction
is necessary in case the ship is yawing in a sea-way so much that the relationship
of the ship&#39;s magnetism to the compass needle is decidedly different from what it
is when the ship is on a comparatively even keel. It is compensated by a vertical
magnet directly underneath (or over) the binnacle, details in regard to which can
be secured from Bowditch Art. 125, p. 53.d from Bowditch Art. 125, p. 53.</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that compass adjustment is not an exact science, that
an adjustment for one latitude is not correct for another, that anyone of a hundred
different causes can affect the magnetism of the ship or of the compass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg
119]</a></span> needle, which in turn directly affects the Deviation. In this connection,
it would be well to read Bowditch Art. 129, p. 55. You should also read Arts. 119-130
in which are given, more fully and in more scientific language, the contents of
this lecture.</p>
